## Before You Start

1. **Review existing work**: Check open issues and discussions to avoid duplicate efforts.
2. **Pick your scope**: Keep changes focused (single plugin, doc, or workflow).
3. **Sync your fork**: `git pull --rebase origin main` before branching.
4. **Plan validation**: Decide which scripts, tests, or screenshots you’ll provide in the PR.

Need help aligning on a large initiative? Open a discussion thread to collaborate with maintainers first.
