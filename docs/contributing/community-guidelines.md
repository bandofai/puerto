# Community Guidelines
> Part of the [Contributing Guide](index.md).

Puerto thrives on a respectful, collaborative community. These guidelines apply to all interactions—GitHub issues, discussions, pull requests, and other channels.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Be respectful** – Assume good intent, address ideas not individuals, and be mindful of tone.
2. **Be inclusive** – Welcome contributors of all backgrounds and experience levels.
3. **Be collaborative** – Share knowledge, document decisions, and help others succeed.
4. **Be transparent** – Disclose conflicts of interest, dependencies, and limitations.
5. **Be responsible** – Design plugins that are safe, ethical, and aligned with community values.

## Communication Standards

- Use clear, constructive language—focus on solutions.
- Avoid sarcasm, personal attacks, or discriminatory remarks.
- Provide context when giving feedback (why something matters, potential impact).
- Thank contributors for their work and celebrate wins together.

---

## Content Expectations

- Plugins must respect user privacy and comply with applicable laws.
- Disclose external services, costs, or data collection practices.
- Avoid shipping malicious code, credential harvesting, or undisclosed telemetry.
- Honour licenses of third-party dependencies and credit sources appropriately.

---

## Moderation Policy

- Maintainers may edit or remove content that violates these guidelines.
- Repeated or severe violations can result in temporary or permanent bans from the repository.
- Escalate concerns to maintainers via private channels or GitHub reports.
- Code of Conduct enforcement follows GitHub’s [Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

---

## How to Report Issues

- For documentation or plugin bugs: open a GitHub issue with reproduction steps.
- For behavioural concerns: contact maintainers privately (see repo README) or use GitHub’s report functionality.
- Include relevant links, screenshots, and timestamps where possible.
