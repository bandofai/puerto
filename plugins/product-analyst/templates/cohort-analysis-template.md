## Leading Indicators of Retention

Analysis of what high-retention users do differently:

### High-Retention Users (Top 25%) vs Low-Retention (Bottom 25%)

| Behavior | High-Retention | Low-Retention | Difference |
|----------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Complete onboarding | 95% | 42% | +53pp |
| Invite team member | 78% | 8% | +70pp |
| Use Feature X in Week 1 | 85% | 15% | +70pp |
| Sessions in first 7 days | 8.2 | 2.1 | +6.1 |
| Time to first value | 5.3 min | 28.7 min | -23.4 min |

**Key Drivers of Retention**:
1. **[Behavior 1]**: Users who [action] are [X]x more likely to retain
2. **[Behavior 2]**: [Impact on retention]

## Churn Analysis

### When Do Users Churn?

| Period | Churn Rate | Cumulative Churn | Users Lost |

## Forward-Looking Metrics

### Projected Churn (Next 90 Days)

Based on current cohort trends:

| Cohort | Size | Expected Churn | Impact |
|--------|------|----------------|--------|
| 2024-10 | 1,523 | 890 (58%) | -$17,800 MRR |
| 2024-09 | 1,412 | 564 (40%) | -$11,280 MRR |
| 2024-08 | 1,687 | 337 (20%) | -$6,748 MRR |

**Total Projected Churn**: [X] users, -$[Y] MRR over next 90 days

**If we improve retention by [Z]pp**: Save [A] users, +$[B] MRR
