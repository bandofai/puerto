# Experimentation Skill

**Production-tested frameworks for rigorous A/B testing and statistical analysis**

This skill codifies best practices from thousands of successful experiments across products and platforms.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Hypothesis-Driven**: Start with clear hypothesis, not random changes
2. **Statistical Rigor**: Respect sample size and significance
3. **One Change at a Time**: Isolate variables for clear causation
4. **Monitor Guardrails**: Watch for negative effects on other metrics
5. **Document Everything**: Learn from both wins and losses

---

## Experiment Lifecycle

### 1. Design Phase

**Define**:
- **Hypothesis**: "We believe [change] will cause [effect] because [reasoning]"
- **Primary Metric**: Main success criterion (conversion rate, revenue, engagement)
- **Secondary Metrics**: Guardrail metrics to watch
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: Smallest change worth detecting (typically 5-20%)
- **Traffic Allocation**: Usually 50/50, sometimes 90/10 for risky tests

**Example Hypothesis**:
```
We believe adding trust badges to the checkout page will increase purchase
completion rate by at least 10% because users don't trust us with their
payment information based on user interviews and session recordings showing
hesitation at the payment step.
```

### 2. Sample Size Calculation

**Formula for Conversion Rates**:

Required sample size per variant = `(Z_α/2 + Z_β)² × [p₁(1-p₁) + p₂(1-p₂)] / (p₂ - p₁)²`

Where:
- `Z_α/2` = 1.96 for 95% confidence (two-tailed)
- `Z_β` = 0.84 for 80% power
- `p₁` = baseline conversion rate
- `p₂` = expected new conversion rate

**Quick Reference**:

| Baseline Rate | Minimum Detectable Effect | Sample Size per Variant |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| 5% | 10% relative (5% → 5.5%) | ~29,000 |
| 5% | 20% relative (5% → 6%) | ~7,300 |
| 10% | 10% relative (10% → 11%) | ~15,000 |
| 10% | 20% relative (10% → 12%) | ~3,800 |
| 20% | 10% relative (20% → 22%) | ~7,400 |
| 20% | 20% relative (20% → 24%) | ~1,900 |

**Runtime Calculation**:
```
Days needed = (Sample size per variant × 2) / (Daily traffic × % allocated to experiment)

Example:
- Need 3,800 per variant = 7,600 total
- Get 1,000 users per day
- Allocating 50% to experiment = 500 per day
- Runtime: 7,600 / 500 = 15.2 days ≈ 16 days
```

### 3. Running Phase

**Best Practices**:
- [ ] Run for at least one full week (capture weekly patterns)
- [ ] Don't peek until sample size reached (prevents false positives)
- [ ] Monitor for Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)
- [ ] Watch for technical issues
- [ ] Check data quality daily

**Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) Check**:
```sql
SELECT
  variant,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS users,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)) OVER (), 2) AS pct,
  CASE
    WHEN ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)) OVER (), 2)
         BETWEEN 48 AND 52 THEN 'OK'
    WHEN ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)) OVER (), 2)
         BETWEEN 45 AND 55 THEN 'WARNING'
    ELSE 'ERROR: SRM DETECTED'
  END AS srm_status
FROM experiment_users
WHERE experiment_id = 'exp_123'
GROUP BY variant;
```

### 4. Analysis Phase

**Statistical Tests**:

**For Conversion Rates (Binary Outcomes)**: Z-test for proportions
```sql
WITH results AS (
  SELECT
    variant,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN converted = TRUE THEN user_id END) AS conversions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN converted = TRUE THEN user_id END) * 1.0 /
      NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id), 0) AS conversion_rate
  FROM experiment_events
  WHERE experiment_id = 'exp_123'
  GROUP BY variant
),

stats AS (
  SELECT
    c.conversion_rate AS control_rate,
    t.conversion_rate AS treatment_rate,
    (t.conversion_rate - c.conversion_rate) AS absolute_lift,
    (t.conversion_rate - c.conversion_rate) / NULLIF(c.conversion_rate, 0) AS relative_lift,

    -- Pooled proportion
    (c.conversions + t.conversions) * 1.0 / (c.users + t.users) AS p_pool,

    -- Standard error
    SQRT(
      ((c.conversions + t.conversions) * 1.0 / (c.users + t.users)) *
      (1 - (c.conversions + t.conversions) * 1.0 / (c.users + t.users)) *
      (1.0 / c.users + 1.0 / t.users)
    ) AS se,

    c.users AS control_users,
    t.users AS treatment_users,
    c.conversions AS control_conversions,
    t.conversions AS treatment_conversions
  FROM results c
  CROSS JOIN results t
  WHERE c.variant = 'control' AND t.variant = 'treatment'
)

SELECT
  control_rate,
  treatment_rate,
  ROUND(absolute_lift * 100, 2) || 'pp' AS absolute_lift,
  ROUND(relative_lift * 100, 2) || '%' AS relative_lift,

  -- Z-score
  ROUND((treatment_rate - control_rate) / NULLIF(se, 0), 3) AS z_score,

  -- Statistical significance
  CASE
    WHEN ABS((treatment_rate - control_rate) / NULLIF(se, 0)) >= 2.576 THEN 'HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT (p<0.01)'
    WHEN ABS((treatment_rate - control_rate) / NULLIF(se, 0)) >= 1.96 THEN 'SIGNIFICANT (p<0.05)'
    WHEN ABS((treatment_rate - control_rate) / NULLIF(se, 0)) >= 1.645 THEN 'MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT (p<0.10)'
    ELSE 'NOT SIGNIFICANT (p>=0.10)'
  END AS significance,

  control_users,
  treatment_users,
  control_conversions,
  treatment_conversions
FROM stats;
```

**For Continuous Metrics (Revenue, Time)**: T-test
```sql
WITH results AS (
  SELECT
    variant,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS n,
    AVG(revenue) AS mean_revenue,
    STDDEV(revenue) AS stddev_revenue
  FROM experiment_events
  WHERE experiment_id = 'exp_123'
  GROUP BY variant
),

stats AS (
  SELECT
    c.mean_revenue AS control_mean,
    t.mean_revenue AS treatment_mean,
    (t.mean_revenue - c.mean_revenue) / NULLIF(c.mean_revenue, 0) AS relative_lift,

    -- Pooled standard deviation
    SQRT(
      ((c.n - 1) * POWER(c.stddev_revenue, 2) + (t.n - 1) * POWER(t.stddev_revenue, 2)) /
      (c.n + t.n - 2)
    ) AS pooled_sd,

    c.n AS control_n,
    t.n AS treatment_n
  FROM results c
  CROSS JOIN results t
  WHERE c.variant = 'control' AND t.variant = 'treatment'
)

SELECT
  ROUND(control_mean, 2) AS control_avg_revenue,
  ROUND(treatment_mean, 2) AS treatment_avg_revenue,
  ROUND(relative_lift * 100, 2) || '%' AS lift,

  -- T-statistic
  ROUND(
    (treatment_mean - control_mean) /
    (pooled_sd * SQRT(1.0/control_n + 1.0/treatment_n)),
    3
  ) AS t_statistic,

  -- Degrees of freedom
  control_n + treatment_n - 2 AS df,

  -- Significance (for t > 1.96 with large df)
  CASE
    WHEN ABS((treatment_mean - control_mean) /
      (pooled_sd * SQRT(1.0/control_n + 1.0/treatment_n))) >= 2.576 THEN 'HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT'
    WHEN ABS((treatment_mean - control_mean) /
      (pooled_sd * SQRT(1.0/control_n + 1.0/treatment_n))) >= 1.96 THEN 'SIGNIFICANT'
    ELSE 'NOT SIGNIFICANT'
  END AS significance
FROM stats;
```

### 5. Decision Framework

**Ship It** (Roll out to 100%) if ALL true:
- ✅ Statistically significant (p < 0.05, Z > 1.96)
- ✅ Practically significant (lift meaningful, e.g., > 5%)
- ✅ Primary metric improved
- ✅ No significant harm to guardrail metrics
- ✅ Sufficient sample size reached
- ✅ Ran long enough (1-2 weeks minimum)
- ✅ No SRM issues
- ✅ Consistent across segments

**Kill It** (Revert to control) if ANY true:
- ❌ Statistically significant decrease in primary metric
- ❌ Significant harm to critical guardrail metrics
- ❌ Major bugs or negative user feedback

**Continue** if:
- 📊 Not yet reached sample size
- 📊 Trending positive but not significant
- 📊 Need more time for weekly patterns

**Investigate** if:
- 🔍 SRM detected
- 🔍 Works for one segment but not others
- 🔍 Conflicting signals
- 🔍 Results seem too good to be true

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Peeking Problem

**Issue**: Checking results before reaching sample size inflates false positive rate.

**Solution**: Pre-commit to sample size and only analyze once reached.

### 2. Multiple Testing

**Issue**: Testing 10 hypotheses, one will be "significant" by chance.

**Solution**: Apply Bonferroni correction (divide α by number of tests).

Example: Testing 5 metrics → Use α = 0.05/5 = 0.01 → Need Z > 2.576

### 3. Novelty Effect

**Issue**: Users excited by new thing, effect fades over time.

**Solution**: Run experiment for 2-4 weeks to see if effect persists.

### 4. Primacy Effect

**Issue**: Existing users disrupted by change, react negatively.

**Solution**: Analyze new users separately, or run longer to let users adapt.

### 5. Simpson's Paradox

**Issue**: Overall result differs from segment results.

**Example**:
- Overall: Treatment wins 10% → 11% (🎉 Ship!)
- Mobile: Treatment loses 5% → 4% (😱 Bad!)
- Desktop: Treatment wins 15% → 18% (🎉 Good!)

**Solution**: Analyze segments, understand trade-offs.

## Experiment Catalog

Keep a catalog of all experiments:

```sql
CREATE TABLE experiments (
  experiment_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
  experiment_name VARCHAR(200),
  hypothesis TEXT,
  start_date DATE,
  end_date DATE,
  status VARCHAR(20), -- 'running', 'shipped', 'killed', 'inconclusive'
  primary_metric VARCHAR(100),
  baseline_rate DECIMAL(5,4),
  treatment_rate DECIMAL(5,4),
  relative_lift DECIMAL(5,2),
  p_value DECIMAL(6,4),
  sample_size_per_variant INTEGER,
  decision VARCHAR(20), -- 'ship', 'kill', 'continue'
  learnings TEXT
);
```

---

## Secondary Metrics Analysis

Always check guardrail metrics:

```sql
SELECT
  m.metric_name,
  c.metric_value AS control_value,
  t.metric_value AS treatment_value,
  ROUND((t.metric_value - c.metric_value) / NULLIF(c.metric_value, 0) * 100, 2) || '%' AS change,
  CASE
    WHEN ABS(t.metric_value - c.metric_value) / c.metric_value > 0.05
         AND p_value < 0.05 THEN 'SIGNIFICANT CHANGE'
    ELSE 'No significant change'
  END AS assessment
FROM metrics m
LEFT JOIN control_results c ON m.metric_name = c.metric_name
LEFT JOIN treatment_results t ON m.metric_name = t.metric_name
WHERE m.metric_type = 'guardrail'
ORDER BY ABS(t.metric_value - c.metric_value) / c.metric_value DESC;
```

---

## Confidence Intervals

Provide range of likely effects:

```sql
-- 95% Confidence Interval for proportions
WITH results AS (
  SELECT
    variant,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS n,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN converted = TRUE THEN user_id END) AS conversions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN converted = TRUE THEN user_id END) * 1.0 /
      NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id), 0) AS p
  FROM experiment_events
  WHERE experiment_id = 'exp_123'
  GROUP BY variant
)

SELECT
  variant,
  ROUND(p * 100, 2) || '%' AS conversion_rate,
  ROUND((p - 1.96 * SQRT(p * (1-p) / n)) * 100, 2) || '%' AS ci_lower,
  ROUND((p + 1.96 * SQRT(p * (1-p) / n)) * 100, 2) || '%' AS ci_upper
FROM results;
```

**Interpretation**: "We are 95% confident the true conversion rate is between X% and Y%"

---

## Sequential Testing (Advanced)

For experiments where you need to peek:

Use **Always Valid p-values** or **Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT)**

This is complex - recommend using existing tools (Optimizely, VWO) or statistical packages.
