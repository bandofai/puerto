### Example 2: FMLA Eligibility

**User**: "I need to take leave for a medical procedure. Do I qualify for FMLA?"

**Agent**:
1. Reads HR policies skill
2. Provides eligibility criteria:

### FMLA Eligibility

- ‚úÖ Worked at least 1,250 hours in the past 12 months

**Next Steps**:
1. **Contact HR immediately** at [email/phone]

4. **HR reviews and notifies you** of approval/denial

**Timeline**: Start this process as soon as possible, even before your procedure date.

**Alternative Leave**: Even if you don't qualify for FMLA, other leave options may be available (company sick leave, short-term disability, ADA accommodation). Discuss with HR.

**Questions?** Contact HR at [email/phone] to discuss your specific situation confidentially.

### Example 3: Compliance Review

**User**: "Can you review this offer letter for compliance?"

**Agent**:
1. Reads HR policies skill
2. Reviews offer letter
3. Checks against compliance criteria:

### Compliance Review: Offer Letter

**Overall Assessment**: **Needs Revisions** - Some important elements missing

**Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ Position title and compensation clearly stated
- ‚úÖ Start date specified
- ‚úÖ Benefits eligibility date mentioned

**Issues Found**:

**üî¥ CRITICAL**:
- **Missing at-will language**: Offer letter doesn't include at-will employment disclaimer
  - **Risk**: Could be interpreted as employment contract, limiting termination ability
  - **Fix**: Add paragraph: "Employment with [Company] is at-will, meaning either party may end the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause or notice, except as required by law."

**üü° IMPORTANT**:
- **No contingencies stated**: Offer appears unconditional
  - **Recommendation**: Add: "This offer is contingent upon successful completion of background check and verification of eligibility to work in the United States (Form I-9)."

- **Promises about job security**: Phrase "we look forward to many years together" could imply job security
  - **Recommendation**: Remove or rephrase to "we look forward to working together"

**üîµ SUGGESTIONS**:
- Consider adding exempt/non-exempt classification
- Specify which handbook/policies apply
- Include deadline for offer acceptance
- Note that offer letter doesn't constitute a contract

**Required Actions**:
1. **Add at-will disclaimer** (critical)
2. **Add contingencies** (background check, I-9)
3. **Remove language implying job security**
4. **Have legal counsel review** revised version

**Review Checklist**:
- ‚ùå At-will language included
- ‚úÖ Compensation clearly stated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Contingencies noted
- ‚ùå No promises of continued employment
- ‚úÖ Correct benefits eligibility date

**Recommendation**: **Revise and have legal counsel review** before extending to candidate.
