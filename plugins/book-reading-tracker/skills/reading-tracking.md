## Reading Methods

### Active Reading Techniques

#### SQ3R Method
The Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review method for effective comprehension.

**1. Survey (5 minutes)**
```
Before reading:
- Scan chapter titles and headings
- Read introduction and conclusion
- Review chapter summaries
- Examine figures, charts, and highlighted text
- Get overview of structure and main ideas

Goal: Build mental framework for content
```

**2. Question (2-3 minutes)**
```
Convert headings to questions:
- "Chapter 3: Climate Change" → "What causes climate change?"
- "Section: Economic Impact" → "How does this affect the economy?"
- List questions you want answered
- Note existing knowledge gaps

Goal: Create curiosity and reading purpose
```

**3. Read (Variable)**
```
Active reading strategies:
- Read to answer your questions
- Mark key passages (don't over-highlight)
- Take brief margin notes
- Pause to reflect at section breaks
- Connect to prior knowledge
- Monitor comprehension

Speed: Adjust based on complexity and importance
```

**4. Recite (After each section)**
```
Without looking at text:
- Summarize section in your own words
- Answer the questions you posed
- Explain key concepts aloud or in writing
- Note what you don't understand
- Create simple examples

Goal: Active recall strengthens memory
```

**5. Review (15-20 minutes)**
```
After completing chapter/book:
- Review notes and highlights
- Summarize main points
- Test yourself on key concepts
- Connect ideas across chapters
- Update your knowledge map

Schedule: Review within 24 hours, then 1 week, then 1 month
```

### Speed Reading Basics

#### When to Use Speed Reading
- **Use for**: Newspaper articles, light fiction, familiar topics, skimming
- **Don't use for**: Complex concepts, poetry, instructions, legal documents

#### Fundamental Techniques

**1. Eliminate Subvocalization**
```
Problem: Reading at speaking speed (150-250 wpm)
Solution:
- Use pointer (finger/pen) to pace eyes
- Chunk words into phrases
- Focus on visual recognition, not "hearing"

Practice: Read faster than you can speak
Result: 300-500 wpm achievable
```

**2. Expand Peripheral Vision**
```
Normal: 1-2 words per fixation
Expanded: 3-5 words per fixation

Exercise:
- Focus on middle word of line
- Absorb surrounding words peripherally
- Reduce eye stops per line

Example:
[The] quick brown fox [jumps]
  ↑                      ↑
2 fixations instead of 5
```

**3. Reduce Regression**
```
Problem: Re-reading previous words (wastes 30% of time)
Solution:
- Use pointer to maintain forward motion
- Trust first pass comprehension
- Mark confusing sections for later review
- Build confidence through practice

Track: Count regressions per page, aim to reduce
```

**4. Chunking Practice**
```
Read phrase groups, not individual words:

❌ The / quick / brown / fox / jumped / over / the / lazy / dog
✓ The quick brown fox / jumped over / the lazy dog

Practice Exercise:
1. Underline phrase boundaries
2. Read entire phrase at one glance
3. Gradually increase chunk size
4. Test comprehension after each page
```

#### Speed Reading Progression

**Week 1-2: Baseline** (150-250 wpm)
```
Focus: Measure current speed
- Read normally for 5 minutes
- Count words read
- Calculate: words ÷ minutes = wpm
- Test comprehension (should be 70%+)
```

**Week 3-4: Pointer Technique** (250-350 wpm)
```
Focus: Visual pacing
- Use pen/finger to guide eyes
- Move pointer steadily (no backtracking)
- Eyes follow pointer
- Gradually increase speed
```

**Week 5-6: Chunking** (350-450 wpm)
```
Focus: Word groups
- Practice 3-word chunks
- Expand to 4-5 word chunks
- Reduce fixations per line
- Maintain 70% comprehension
```

**Week 7-8: Advanced** (450-600 wpm)
```
Focus: Integration
- Combine all techniques
- Vary speed by material
- Practice daily (20 minutes)
- Test comprehension regularly
```

#### Comprehension Maintenance

**Self-Testing Protocol**
```
After each chapter:
1. What was the main idea?
2. What were 3 supporting points?
3. What was surprising or new?
4. How does this connect to previous knowledge?
5. What questions remain?

Passing score: Answer 4/5 confidently
If below: Slow down and re-read
```

### Note-Taking Systems

#### Cornell Method

**Page Layout**
```

```

**Three Sections**

**Notes Area (During Reading)**
```
- Record main ideas and details
- Use bullet points and short phrases
- Include page numbers
- Draw diagrams if helpful
- Leave space between topics
- Use abbreviations consistently

Example:
p. 45 - Climate change causes
  • Greenhouse gases (CO2, methane)
  • Deforestation reduces CO2 absorption
  • Industrial revolution = acceleration
  • Feedback loops amplify effects
```

**Cues Column (After Reading)**
```
- Write questions from notes
- Add keywords and tags
- Note connections to other material
- Flag important concepts
- Create memory triggers

Example:
Main causes?
└─ GHG, deforestation

Feedback loops?
└─ Melting ice reduces reflection

When started?
└─ Industrial revolution
```

**Summary Section (At End)**
```
- 2-3 sentence overview
- Main takeaway
- Personal reaction or insight
- Connection to bigger picture

Example:
Climate change primarily driven by human GHG
emissions since industrial era. Multiple feedback
loops accelerate warming. Understanding causes
essential for developing solutions.
```

**Review Process**
```
1. Cover notes area, read cues
2. Recite answers from memory
3. Check against notes
4. Identify weak areas
5. Review summary

Schedule:
- Same day: 10 minutes
- 1 week later: 5 minutes
- 1 month later: 5 minutes
```

#### Highlight System

**Color-Coding Strategy**

**Physical Books**
```
Yellow:    Key concepts and main ideas
Blue:      Beautiful language or memorable quotes
Green:     Questions or confusing sections
Pink:      Personal favorites or impactful passages

Rules:
- Highlight sparingly (max 10% of page)
- Full sentences or meaningful phrases
- Add margin notes for context
- Use symbols: *, !, ?, → (connection)
```

**Digital Books (Kindle/Apple Books)**
```
Categories:
- Highlight:  Important content
- Note:       Personal thoughts
- Bookmark:   Key chapters/sections

Best Practices:
- Export highlights regularly
- Organize by book/topic
- Review monthly
- Create summary documents
```

#### Margin Notes System

**Symbol Key**
```
*     Important concept
!     Surprising or impactful
?     Question or confusion
→     Leads to/connects to
=     Equals/definition
ex    Example needed
cf    Compare/contrast with
□     Action item or to research
✓     Confirmed understanding
Δ     Change in perspective
```

**Note Types**

**1. Summary Notes**
```
Brief section summaries:

p. 45 [Sum: Main causes of climate change
identified - GHG primary driver]
```

**2. Connection Notes**
```
Link to other ideas:

p. 67 [→ Similar to "Thinking Fast & Slow"
system 1/2 concept]
```

**3. Question Notes**

             and 5 books over 500 pages"

Elements:
- Exact number
- Category breakdown
- Diversity targets
- Challenge elements
```

**Measurable**
```
Quantifiable Metrics:
- Books completed: 50
- Pages read: 15,000

Is this achievable?
- Average book: 300 pages
- Reading speed: 40 pages/hour
- Time per book: 7.5 hours
- Time per month: ~20 hours
- Available: 1 hour/day = 30 hours/month ✓

Feasibility: YES, with consistent daily reading
```

**Relevant**
```
Why this goal matters:

Personal Growth:
- Expand knowledge in career field
- Improve critical thinking
- Reduce screen time
- Better sleep routine (read before bed)

Life Goals Connection:
- Career: Stay current in industry (12 tech books)
- Health: Read 6 wellness books
- Relationships: 4 communication books
- Creativity: 8 fiction books for inspiration

The "So What?" Test:
Will achieving this goal improve my life? YES
```

**Time-Bound**
```
Timeline Structure:

Annual Goal: 50 books by Dec 31, 2025

Quarterly Milestones:
- Q1 (Jan-Mar): 13 books
- Q2 (Apr-Jun): 13 books
- Q3 (Jul-Sep): 12 books
- Q4 (Oct-Dec): 12 books

Monthly Targets:

```

### Common Reading Challenges

#### 52 Books Per Year Challenge

**The Math**
```
Goal: 52 books = 1 book per week
Average book: 300 pages
Total pages: 15,600
Daily reading: 43 pages/day

Time Investment:
- Reading speed: 40 pages/hour
- Daily time: 1 hour 5 minutes
- Weekly time: 7.5 hours

Reality Check:
- Do you have 1+ hour daily?
- Can you maintain for 365 days?
- What about vacation/busy periods?
```

**Strategy Options**

**Option A: Consistent Daily** (Recommended)
```
Schedule: 1 hour every evening
- Monday-Friday: 7-8pm (5 hours)
- Saturday-Sunday: 2 hours each (4 hours)
- Total: 9 hours/week
- Books: 1.2/week average

Pros: Habit formation, steady progress
Cons: Requires discipline
```

**Option B: Variable Length**
```
Book Mix:
- 12 short books (100-200 pages): 2-3 hours each
- 30 medium books (250-350 pages): 6-8 hours each
- 10 long books (400+ pages): 10-15 hours each

Strategy: Mix short and long to maintain pace
- Start month with short book (early win)
- Alternate medium and long
- End with medium book
```

**Option C: Format Mix**
```
Combine formats for efficiency:
- 30 print books (careful reading)
- 12 audiobooks (commute/exercise)
- 10 ebooks (quick reads, travel)

Daily routine:
- Morning: Audiobook during workout (30 min)
- Evening: Print book (45 min)
- Bedtime: Ebook (15 min light reading)

Result: Multiple books in progress, faster completion
```

**Common Pitfalls**

**1. Slump Recovery**
```
Problem: Fall behind in busy months

Solution:
- Don't quit - adjust goal temporarily
- Read shorter books to rebuild momentum
- Switch to easier genres
- Use audiobooks for low-energy periods
- Remember: 40 books > 0 books

Recovery plan:
- Week 1: 1 short book (100 pages)
- Week 2: 1 medium book (250 pages)
- Week 3: 1 medium book + start next
- Week 4: Back to 1 book/week pace
```

**2. Over-Ambitious Start**
```
Problem: Read 8 books in January, burn out by March

Prevention:
- Pace yourself: 4-5 books/month consistently
- Don't frontload
- Save "buffer" books for December
- Quality over quantity
- Rest days are okay

Better approach:
Aim for 45, achieve 50+ (vs. aim for 60, quit at 30)
```

**3. DNF (Did Not Finish) Management**
```
Rule: Life's too short for bad books

When to DNF:
- After 50 pages if not engaging
- After 100 pages if still not enjoying
- If dreading picking it up
- If forcing yourself to continue

Process:
- Mark as DNF in tracker
- Don't count toward goal
- Brief note why (genre mismatch, not right time, etc.)
- May revisit later
- No guilt!

Impact: Frees time for books you'll actually enjoy
```

#### Genre Diversity Challenge

**Balanced Reading Plan**

**12-Month Genre Rotation**
```
Month 1:  Fiction - Literary
Month 2:  Non-fiction - Biography
Month 3:  Fiction - Science Fiction
Month 4:  Non-fiction - History
Month 5:  Fiction - Mystery/Thriller
Month 6:  Non-fiction - Science
Month 7:  Fiction - Fantasy
Month 8:  Non-fiction - Psychology
Month 9:  Fiction - Historical Fiction
Month 10: Non-fiction - Business/Self-help

   - Been on TBR > 1 year? Why?
   - "Should read" vs "Want to read"?
   - Remove guilt-driven books

2. Fresh start
   - Remove 20-30% of Someday/Maybe
   - Donate/sell books won't read
   - Free mental space

3. New directions
   - Emerging interests?
   - New authors discovered?
   - Goal adjustments?

4. Size target
   - Keep TBR under 50 books
   - Manageable, not overwhelming
   - Quality over quantity
```

### Priority Systems

#### Eisenhower Matrix for Books

**Four Quadrants**

**Q1: Urgent & Important** (Read immediately)
```
Examples:
- Book club book, meeting next week
- Borrowed book, due soon
- Work-related, need for project
- Gift from important person
- Course required reading

Action: Read NOW
Time allocation: 40% of reading time
```

**Q2: Important, Not Urgent** (Schedule)
```
Examples:
- Career development books
- Classic literature goals
- Personal growth priorities
- Research for future project

Action: SCHEDULE specific time
Time allocation: 40% of reading time
Tip: This is where most goal progress happens
```

**Q3: Urgent, Not Important** (Minimize)
```
Examples:
- Trending book (FOMO)
- Everyone's talking about it
- New release hype
- Free/on sale

Action: Read selectively or skip
Time allocation: 10% of reading time
Warning: Often leads to DNF
```

**Q4: Neither Urgent Nor Important** (Eliminate)
```
Examples:
- Old "should read" guilt
- Random purchases
- Inherited books
- Outdated material

Action: REMOVE from TBR
Time allocation: 10% or less
Tip: Donate/sell these books
```

#### ROI-Based Priority

**Return on Investment Ranking**

**Calculate Book ROI**
```
ROI Score = (Potential Value × Relevance) / Time Investment

Potential Value (1-10):
- How much will I learn?
- Will it improve my life?
- Entertainment value?

Relevance (1-10):
- Aligns with current goals?
- Timely content?
- Practical applicability?

Time Investment:
- Hours to complete
- Difficulty/density

Example:
Book A: (9 × 10) / 8 hours = 11.25
Book B: (6 × 5) / 15 hours = 2.0

Read Book A first!
```

**Priority Tiers by ROI**
```
Tier 1 (ROI > 10): Read immediately
Tier 2 (ROI 5-10): Schedule this month
Tier 3 (ROI 2-5): Schedule this quarter
Tier 4 (ROI < 2): Consider removing
```

### Reading Pace Calculation

#### Basic Calculations

**Pages Per Day**
```python
def pages_per_day(book):
    """Calculate average pages per day for a book"""
    start = book['dateStarted']
    end = book['dateCompleted']
    days = (end - start).days

    if days == 0:
        days = 1  # Same-day completion

    pages = book['pages']
    return pages / days

# Example:
# Book: 350 pages
# Started: Jan 1
# Completed: Jan 8
# Days: 7
# PPD: 350 / 7 = 50 pages/day
```

**Books Per Month**
```python
def books_per_month(year):
    """Calculate books per month average"""
    books = get_completed_books(year)

    # Group by month
    monthly = defaultdict(int)
    for book in books:
        month = book['dateCompleted'].strftime('%Y-%m')
        monthly[month] += 1

    # Calculate average
    total_books = len(books)
    total_months = len(monthly)

    if total_months == 0:
        return 0

    avg = total_books / total_months
    return round(avg, 2)

# Example:
# 50 books in year
# Active in 12 months
# BPM: 50 / 12 = 4.17 books/month
```

**Reading Speed (WPM)**
```python
def calculate_wpm(pages, minutes, words_per_page=250):
    """Estimate reading speed in words per minute"""
    total_words = pages * words_per_page
    wpm = total_words / minutes
    return round(wpm)

# Example:
# Read 30 pages in 45 minutes
# Assumed 250 words/page
# Total words: 30 × 250 = 7,500
# WPM: 7,500 / 45 = 167 wpm
```

**Time to Complete Current Book**
```python
def estimate_completion(book, pages_per_day):
    """Estimate days until completion"""
    current_page = book['currentPage']
    total_pages = book['pages']
    remaining = total_pages - current_page

    days_remaining = remaining / pages_per_day
    estimated_date = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=days_remaining)

    return {
        'pagesRemaining': remaining,
        'daysRemaining': round(days_remaining, 1),
        'estimatedCompletion': estimated_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
        'completionPct': round((current_page / total_pages) * 100, 1)
    }

# Example:
# Book: 400 pages total
# Current page: 150
# Reading pace: 40 pages/day
# Remaining: 250 pages
# Days remaining: 250 / 40 = 6.25 days
# Estimated completion: 6 days from now
```

#### Advanced Pace Metrics

**Velocity Trend Analysis**
```python
def velocity_trend(books, window=30):
    """Calculate 30-day rolling average reading velocity"""
    sessions = []

    for book in books:
        if 'sessions' in book:
            sessions.extend(book['sessions'])

    # Group by date
    daily_pages = defaultdict(int)
    for session in sessions:
        date = session['date']
        daily_pages[date] += session['pagesRead']

    # Calculate rolling average
    dates = sorted(daily_pages.keys())
    rolling_avg = []

    for i in range(len(dates)):
        window_start = max(0, i - window + 1)
        window_dates = dates[window_start:i + 1]
        window_pages = [daily_pages[d] for d in window_dates]

        avg = sum(window_pages) / len(window_pages)
        rolling_avg.append({
            'date': dates[i],
            'avgPagesPerDay': round(avg, 1)
        })

    return rolling_avg

# Shows: Are you reading faster or slower over time?
```

**Genre-Specific Pace**
```python
def pace_by_genre(books):
    """Calculate reading pace for each genre"""
    genre_data = defaultdict(list)

    for book in books:
        if 'dateStarted' in book and 'dateCompleted' in book:
            days = (book['dateCompleted'] - book['dateStarted']).days
            if days > 0:
                ppd = book['pages'] / days

                for genre in book['genre']:
                    genre_data[genre].append({
                        'ppd': ppd,
                        'days': days,
                        'pages': book['pages']
                    })

    # Calculate stats per genre
    genre_stats = {}
    for genre, data in genre_data.items():
        ppd_values = [d['ppd'] for d in data]
        days_values = [d['days'] for d in data]
        pages_values = [d['pages'] for d in data]

        genre_stats[genre] = {
            'avgPagesPerDay': round(statistics.mean(ppd_values), 1),
            'avgDaysPerBook': round(statistics.mean(days_values), 1),
            'avgBookLength': round(statistics.mean(pages_values), 0),
            'bookCount': len(data)
        }

    return genre_stats

# Example Output:
# {
#   "Science Fiction": {
#     "avgPagesPerDay": 45.3,
#     "avgDaysPerBook": 8.2,
#     "avgBookLength": 372,
#     "bookCount": 12
#   },
#   "Non-fiction": {
#     "avgPagesPerDay": 28.7,
#     "avgDaysPerBook": 12.5,
#     "avgBookLength": 358,
#     "bookCount": 15
#   }
# }
```

**Difficulty Adjustment**
```python
def adjusted_pace(book, base_pace):
    """Adjust expected pace based on book characteristics"""
    pace = base_pace

    # Adjust for length
    if book['pages'] > 500:
        pace *= 0.9  # 10% slower for long books

    # Adjust for genre
    if 'Non-fiction' in book['genre']:
        pace *= 0.75  # 25% slower
    if 'Philosophy' in book['genre']:
        pace *= 0.6  # 40% slower
    if 'Fiction' in book['genre'] and 'Thriller' in book['genre']:
        pace *= 1.2  # 20% faster (page-turners)

    # Adjust for format
    if book['format'] == 'Audiobook':
        pace *= 1.3  # Can "read" faster while multitasking

    return round(pace, 1)

# Example:
# Base pace: 40 pages/day
# Book: 550-page non-fiction philosophy
# Adjusted: 40 × 0.9 × 0.75 × 0.6 = 16.2 pages/day
# More realistic estimate!
```

### Genre Distribution

#### Calculation Methods

**Basic Distribution**
```python
def genre_distribution(books):
    """Calculate percentage distribution of genres"""
    genre_counts = defaultdict(int)

    for book in books:
        for genre in book.get('genre', []):
            genre_counts[genre] += 1

    total = sum(genre_counts.values())

    distribution = {}
    for genre, count in genre_counts.items():
        pct = (count / total) * 100
        distribution[genre] = {
            'count': count,
            'percentage': round(pct, 1)
        }

    # Sort by percentage
    return dict(sorted(distribution.items(),
                       key=lambda x: x[1]['percentage'],
                       reverse=True))

# Example Output:
# {
#   "Fiction": {"count": 25, "percentage": 50.0},
#   "Science Fiction": {"count": 12, "percentage": 24.0},
#   "Non-fiction": {"count": 8, "percentage": 16.0},
#   "History": {"count": 5, "percentage": 10.0}
# }
```

**Visualization**
```python
def genre_chart(distribution, max_width=50):
    """Create ASCII bar chart of genre distribution"""
    print("Genre Distribution:\n")

    sorted_genres = sorted(distribution.items(),
                          key=lambda x: x[1]['percentage'],
                          reverse=True)

    for genre, data in sorted_genres:
        pct = data['percentage']
        count = data['count']
        bar_length = int((pct / 100) * max_width)
        bar = '█' * bar_length

        print(f"{genre:20s} ({pct:5.1f}%) {bar} {count}")

# Example Output:
# Genre Distribution:
#
# Fiction              (50.0%) █████████████████████████ 25
# Science Fiction      (24.0%) ████████████ 12
# Non-fiction          (16.0%) ████████ 8
# History              (10.0%) █████ 5
```

#### Diversity Analysis

**Genre Diversity Score**
```python
def genre_diversity_score(books):
    """Calculate Shannon entropy (diversity metric)"""
    import math

    dist = genre_distribution(books)
    entropy = 0

    for genre, data in dist.items():
        p = data['percentage'] / 100  # Convert to probability
        if p > 0:
            entropy += -p * math.log2(p)

    # Normalize to 0-100 scale
    max_entropy = math.log2(len(dist))  # Max possible entropy
    diversity_score = (entropy / max_entropy) * 100 if max_entropy > 0 else 0

    return {
        'score': round(diversity_score, 1),
        'interpretation': interpret_diversity(diversity_score),
        'genreCount': len(dist)
    }

def interpret_diversity(score):
    """Interpret diversity score"""
    if score >= 80:
        return "Very diverse - excellent variety"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "Moderately diverse - good balance"
    elif score >= 40:
        return "Somewhat concentrated - consider expanding"
    else:
        return "Highly concentrated - limited variety"

# Example:
# 5 genres, even distribution (20% each)
# Entropy: high
# Score: 100 (perfect diversity)
#
# 5 genres, one dominates (70%, others 7.5% each)
# Entropy: low
# Score: 45 (concentrated)
```

**Genre Evolution Over Time**
```python
def genre_trends(books, period='quarterly'):
    """Track how genre preferences change over time"""
    from collections import defaultdict
    from datetime import datetime

    # Group books by time period
    period_genres = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))

    for book in books:
        date = book['dateCompleted']

        if period == 'monthly':
            key = date.strftime('%Y-%m')
        elif period == 'quarterly':
            quarter = (date.month - 1) // 3 + 1
            key = f"{date.year}-Q{quarter}"
        elif period == 'yearly':
            key = str(date.year)

### Time Investment

#### Total Reading Time

**Estimation Methods**

**Method 1: Session Tracking**
```python
def total_reading_time(books):
    """Calculate total time from logged sessions"""
    total_minutes = 0

    for book in books:
        if 'sessions' in book:
            for session in book['sessions']:
                total_minutes += session['duration']

    hours = total_minutes / 60
    days = hours / 24

    return {
        'totalMinutes': total_minutes,
        'totalHours': round(hours, 1),
        'totalDays': round(days, 2),
        'avgHoursPerWeek': round(hours / 52, 1)  # Assuming yearly
    }

# Example:
# 180 hours of reading
# = 3.46 hours/week
# = 30 minutes/day average
```

**Method 2: Pace-Based Estimation**
```python
def estimate_reading_time(books, avg_pages_per_hour=40):
    """Estimate time based on pages read"""
    total_pages = sum(book['pages'] for book in books)
    estimated_hours = total_pages / avg_pages_per_hour

    return {
        'totalPages': total_pages,
        'estimatedHours': round(estimated_hours, 1),
        'avgHoursPerBook': round(estimated_hours / len(books), 1)
    }

# Example:
# 50 books, avg 300 pages = 15,000 pages
# At 40 pages/hour = 375 hours
# = 7.5 hours per book average
```

#### Time by Category

**Genre Time Investment**
```python
def time_by_genre(books, avg_pages_per_hour=40):
    """Calculate time investment per genre"""
    genre_time = defaultdict(lambda: {'pages': 0, 'books': 0})

    for book in books:
        for genre in book.get('genre', []):
            genre_time[genre]['pages'] += book['pages']
            genre_time[genre]['books'] += 1

    # Calculate hours
    results = {}
    for genre, data in genre_time.items():
        hours = data['pages'] / avg_pages_per_hour
        results[genre] = {
            'books': data['books'],
            'pages': data['pages'],
            'hours': round(hours, 1),
            'avgHoursPerBook': round(hours / data['books'], 1),
            'percentage': 0  # Calculate after getting total
        }

    # Calculate percentages
    total_hours = sum(g['hours'] for g in results.values())
    for genre in results:
        pct = (results[genre]['hours'] / total_hours) * 100
        results[genre]['percentage'] = round(pct, 1)

    return results

# Example Output:
# {
#   "Fiction": {
#     "books": 25,
#     "pages": 7500,
#     "hours": 187.5,
#     "avgHoursPerBook": 7.5,
#     "percentage": 50.0
#   },
#   "Non-fiction": {
#     "books": 15,
#     "pages": 5400,
#     "hours": 135.0,
#     "avgHoursPerBook": 9.0,
#     "percentage": 36.0
#   }
# }
```

**Monthly Time Investment**
```python
def monthly_time_breakdown(year):
    """Time spent reading each month"""
    monthly = defaultdict(lambda: {'pages': 0, 'books': 0})

    books = get_completed_books(year)

    for book in books:
        month = book['dateCompleted'].strftime('%Y-%m')
        monthly[month]['pages'] += book['pages']
        monthly[month]['books'] += 1

    # Calculate hours
    for month in monthly:
        hours = monthly[month]['pages'] / 40  # 40 pages/hour
        monthly[month]['hours'] = round(hours, 1)
        monthly[month]['avgHoursPerDay'] = round(hours / 30, 1)

    return dict(sorted(monthly.items()))

# Example:
# {
#   "2025-01": {
#     "books": 5,
#     "pages": 1500,
#     "hours": 37.5,
#     "avgHoursPerDay": 1.25
#   },
#   "2025-02": {
#     "books": 4,
#     "pages": 1200,
#     "hours": 30.0,
#     "avgHoursPerDay": 1.0
#   }
# }
```

#### ROI Analysis

**Value Per Hour Reading**
```python
def calculate_reading_roi(books):
    """Assess value gained vs time invested"""

    results = []
    for book in books:
        # Time investment
        hours = book['pages'] / 40  # Estimate

        # Value factors
        rating = book.get('rating', 0)
        learning_value = book.get('learningValue', 0)  # User-defined 1-10
        enjoyment = book.get('enjoyment', rating)  # Default to rating

        # Calculate composite value
        total_value = (rating + learning_value + enjoyment) / 3

        # ROI = Value / Time
        roi = total_value / hours if hours > 0 else 0

        results.append({
            'title': book['title'],
            'hours': round(hours, 1),
            'value': round(total_value, 2),
            'roi': round(roi, 3),
            'worthIt': roi > 0.5  # Threshold: 0.5 value points per hour
        })

    return sorted(results, key=lambda x: x['roi'], reverse=True)

# High ROI books: Short + high value = best use of time
# Low ROI books: Long + low value = time could be better spent
```

### Progress Visualization

#### Progress Bar Formats

**Simple Progress Bar**
```python
def progress_bar(current, total, width=20):
    """Generate ASCII progress bar"""
    pct = (current / total) * 100
    filled = int((current / total) * width)
    empty = width - filled

    bar = '█' * filled + '░' * empty
    return f"[{bar}] {pct:.1f}% ({current}/{total})"

# Example:
# progress_bar(32, 50, 20)
# Output: [████████████░░░░░░░░] 64.0% (32/50)
```

**Detailed Progress Display**
```python
def book_progress_display(book):
    """Show detailed progress for current book"""
    current = book['currentPage']
    total = book['pages']
    pct = (current / total) * 100
    remaining = total - current

    # Calculate estimated completion
    ppd = 40  # pages per day (could calculate from history)
    days_remaining = remaining / ppd

    # Visual bar
    bar = progress_bar(current, total, 30)

    print(f"Book: {book['title']}")
    print(f"Progress: {bar}")
    print(f"Pages remaining: {remaining}")
    print(f"Est. days to complete: {days_remaining:.1f}")
    print(f"Target completion: {estimate_completion_date(days_remaining)}")

# Example Output:
# Book: Project Hail Mary
# Progress: [██████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 60.0% (285/476)
# Pages remaining: 191
# Est. days to complete: 4.8
# Target completion: 2025-01-25
```

**Annual Goal Progress**
```python
def annual_goal_progress(goal_books, completed_books, current_date, year):
    """Detailed annual goal visualization"""

    # Calculate progress
    progress_pct = (completed_books / goal_books) * 100

    # Calculate expected progress
    days_elapsed = (current_date - datetime(year, 1, 1)).days
    days_in_year = 365
    expected_pct = (days_elapsed / days_in_year) * 100
    expected_books = (goal_books * expected_pct) / 100

    # Status
    books_ahead = completed_books - expected_books
    on_track = completed_books >= expected_books

    # Projection
    books_per_day = completed_books / days_elapsed if days_elapsed > 0 else 0
    projected_total = books_per_day * days_in_year

    # Visual
    bar_width = 40
    filled = int((completed_books / goal_books) * bar_width)
    empty = bar_width - filled
    bar = '█' * filled + '░' * empty

    # Status indicator
    if books_ahead >= 3:
        status = "🔥 Ahead"
        color = "green"
    elif books_ahead >= 0:
        status = "✓ On Track"
        color = "green"
    elif books_ahead >= -3:
        status = "⚠ Slightly Behind"
        color = "yellow"
    else:
        status = "❌ Behind"
        color = "red"

    print(f"Annual Reading Goal: {goal_books} books")
    print(f"[{bar}] {progress_pct:.1f}%")

    print(f"Status: {status} ({books_ahead:+.1f} books)")
    print(f"")
    print(f"Projection: {projected_total:.0f} books by year end")
    print(f"Remaining: {goal_books - completed_books} books")
    print(f"Days remaining: {days_in_year - days_elapsed}")
    print(f"Pace needed: {(goal_books - completed_books) / (days_in_year - days_elapsed) * 7:.2f} books/week")

# Example Output:
# Annual Reading Goal: 50 books
# [████████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 60.0%
#
# Completed: 30 books
# Expected: 28.5 books
# Status: ✓ On Track (+1.5 books)
#
# Projection: 52 books by year end
# Remaining: 20 books
# Days remaining: 150
# Pace needed: 0.93 books/week
```

#### Chart Types

**Monthly Books Chart**
```python
def monthly_books_chart(year):
    """Horizontal bar chart of books per month"""
    monthly = books_per_month_data(year)
    max_books = max(monthly.values())

    months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun',
              'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']

    for i, month in enumerate(months, 1):
        month_key = f"{year}-{i:02d}"
        count = monthly.get(month_key, 0)

        # Scale bar to max width
        bar_length = int((count / max_books) * 30) if max_books > 0 else 0
        bar = '█' * bar_length

        print(f"{month} |{bar} {count}")

    print(f"\nTotal: {sum(monthly.values())} books")
    print(f"Average: {sum(monthly.values()) / 12:.1f} books/month")

# Example Output:

**Genre Pie Chart (ASCII)**
```python
def genre_pie_chart(books):
    """Text-based pie chart of genre distribution"""
    dist = genre_distribution(books)

    print("Genre Distribution\n")

    sorted_genres = sorted(dist.items(),
                          key=lambda x: x[1]['percentage'],
                          reverse=True)

    for genre, data in sorted_genres:
        pct = data['percentage']
        count = data['count']

        # Create proportional bar
        bar_length = int(pct / 2)  # Scale to 50 chars max
        bar = '█' * bar_length

        print(f"{genre:20s} ({pct:5.1f}%) {bar} {count} books")

    print(f"\nTotal: {sum(d['count'] for d in dist.values())} books")
    print(f"Genres: {len(dist)}")

# Example Output:

## Retention

### Summary Writing

#### Book Summary Framework

**Three-Tier Summary System**

**1. One-Sentence Summary**
```
Purpose: Quick reference, easy recall
Length: Single sentence
Content: Core message or plot

Template:
"[Book Title] is about [main subject] and shows/argues that [key insight]."

Examples:

Fiction:
"Project Hail Mary is about a scientist alone in space who must save Earth from extinction using creative problem-solving."

Non-fiction:
"Atomic Habits argues that tiny changes in behavior compound into remarkable results through systematic habit formation."

Biography:
"Steve Jobs chronicles the life of Apple's co-founder, exploring his genius, perfectionism, and impact on technology."
```

**2. Three-Paragraph Summary**
```
Purpose: Solid understanding, discussion starter
Length: 150-200 words
Structure: Setup → Development → Resolution/Conclusion

Template:

Paragraph 1 - Setup (What & Why):
- What is the book about?
- Why does it matter?
- Key context/background

Paragraph 2 - Development (How):
- Main arguments/plot points
- Key evidence/events
- Significant developments

Paragraph 3 - Resolution (So What):
- Conclusions reached
- Impact on understanding
- Personal takeaway

Example (Non-fiction):

Thinking, Fast and Slow explores the two systems that drive
human thinking: the fast, intuitive System 1 and the slow,
deliberate System 2. Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner, draws
on decades of research in cognitive psychology and behavioral
economics to reveal how these systems shape our decisions.

The book demonstrates how System 1's quick judgments often
lead to systematic errors (cognitive biases) while System 2,
though more reliable, is lazy and prone to accepting System
1's suggestions. Through experiments and real-world examples,
Kahneman shows how biases like anchoring, availability, and
overconfidence affect everything from business decisions to
medical diagnoses.

Understanding these two systems helps us recognize when we're
relying too heavily on intuition and need to engage more careful
analysis. While we can't eliminate biases, awareness allows us
to design better decision-making processes and recognize when
stakes are high enough to warrant slow, deliberate thinking.
```

**3. Detailed Summary**

### Key Insights Extraction

#### Insight Identification Process

**Step 1: During Reading**
```
Mark insights as you encounter them:

Signs of a key insight:
- "Aha!" moment
- Challenges existing belief
- Practical applicability
- Novel perspective
- Connects multiple ideas
- Emotionally resonant

Marking method:
- Flag page/location
- Brief note: "Key insight: [topic]"
- Don't fully articulate yet
```

**Step 2: After Reading**
```
Review flagged sections:

For each flagged insight:
1. Re-read in context
2. Articulate in own words
3. Ask: Why is this significant?
4. Ask: How does this apply?
5. Ask: Does it contradict or confirm other knowledge?

Consolidate:
- Combine related insights
- Eliminate redundancies
- Rank by importance/applicability
```

**Step 3: Distillation**
```
Extract top 3-5 insights:

Format:
**Insight**: [One sentence statement]
**Explanation**: [Why this matters, 2-3 sentences]
**Application**: [How to use this, 1-2 sentences]
**Source**: [Book, page/chapter reference]

Example:

**Insight**: Small habits compound into remarkable results over time.

**Explanation**: A 1% improvement every day leads to being 37x
better after one year due to compounding effects. Conversely, 1%
decline daily results in declining to nearly zero. The difference
between success and failure is often small, repeated actions.

**Application**: Focus on tiny, sustainable improvements rather
than dramatic transformations. Track daily habits and ensure more
are moving in positive direction than negative.

**Source**: Atomic Habits by James Clear, Chapter 1
```

#### Insight Organization

**By Theme**
```
Organize insights across books by common themes:

Theme: Habit Formation
├── Atomic Habits: 1% daily improvement compounds
├── The Power of Habit: Cue → Routine → Reward loop
├── Tiny Habits: Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt
└── [Synthesis]: Common principles of lasting change

Theme: Decision Making
├── Thinking Fast & Slow: System 1 vs System 2 thinking
├── Predictably Irrational: We're systematically irrational
├── Decisive: WRAP framework for better choices
└── [Synthesis]: Multi-faceted decision-making toolkit
```

**By Application Area**
```
Organize by where insights apply:

Career/Work:
- Deep Work: Focused attention is scarce and valuable
- So Good They Can't Ignore You: Skill trumps passion
- The Effective Executive: Effectiveness can be learned

Relationships:
- Nonviolent Communication: Observations vs judgments
- The Five Love Languages: People give/receive love differently
- Crucial Conversations: Dialogue requires psychological safety

Personal Growth:
- [Continue by life area]
```

```

**Optimal Review Intervals**

**Initial Learning** (just finished book)
```
Day 0 (completion):
- Write summary
- Extract key insights
- Create review materials

Day 1 (next day):
- Review summary (5 min)
- Quiz yourself on main points
- Identify weak areas

Day 3 (3 days later):
- Review again (3 min)
- Can you explain to someone?
- Refresh weak areas

Day 7 (1 week later):
- Review summary (3 min)
- Quiz on key insights
- Apply one insight
```

**Long-term Retention** (after initial learning)
```
Week 2: Quick review (2 min)
Week 4: Quick review (2 min)
Month 3: Comprehensive review (10 min)
Month 6: Quick review (2 min)
Month 12: Comprehensive review (10 min)
Yearly: Annual review

Total time investment: ~30 minutes over one year
Retention: 80-90% vs 10-20% without review
```

#### Review Methods

**Method 1: Flashcard System**
```
Create flashcards for key concepts:

Front: "What is the main argument of [Book Title]?"
Back: [One-sentence summary]

Front: "According to [Author], what causes [phenomenon]?"
Back: [Explanation from book]

Front: "How can I apply [concept] to my work?"
Back: [Specific application]

Tools:
- Physical index cards
- Anki (digital flashcards with spaced repetition)
- Notion database
- Simple text file

Review process:
- Shuffle deck
- Answer before flipping
- Correct → longer interval before next review
- Incorrect → review again sooner
```

**Method 2: Summary Re-reading**
```
Keep summaries accessible:

File structure:
books/
├── 2024/
│   ├── atomic-habits-summary.md
│   ├── project-hail-mary-summary.md
│   └── ...
└── 2025/
    └── ...

Review process:
- Sunday evening: Read 2-3 summaries (10 min)
- Pick from different time periods
- Focus on books relevant to current goals
- Update summary if new insights emerge
```

**Method 3: Active Recall Questions**
```
After reading, create self-test questions:

Questions to ask:
1. What was this book about?
2. What were the 3 main points?
3. What evidence did the author provide?
4. What was surprising or counterintuitive?
5. How does this relate to other books I've read?
6. What's one thing I can implement this week?
7. What questions do I still have?

Store questions with book notes
Review and answer questions at spaced intervals
Track which questions you struggle with
```

**Method 4: Teaching/Explaining**
```
The Feynman Technique:

Step 1: Write down everything you know about the book
(Don't look at notes)

Step 2: Explain it to a novice
(Could you explain to someone unfamiliar?)

Step 3: Identify gaps
(What did you struggle to explain?)

Step 4: Review and simplify
(Go back to book for gaps, clarify complex language)

Step 5: Explain again
(Now it should be crystal clear)

Benefits:
- Reveals actual understanding vs. recognition
- Simplification aids retention
- Teaching others reinforces learning
```

#### Digital Tools for Spaced Repetition

```

### Application of Learnings

#### From Insight to Action

**Action Planning Framework**

**Step 1: Identify Actionable Insights**
```
Review key insights and ask:
- Can I implement this?
- Is it relevant to my current goals?
- Will it make a measurable difference?

Example (from Atomic Habits):

Insight: "Environment design is more powerful than willpower"

Actionable? YES
Relevant? YES (want to build reading habit)
Impact? HIGH (can immediately apply)

→ Add to implementation list
```

**Step 2: Define Specific Actions**
```
Convert insight into concrete actions:

Template:
I will [specific behavior]
in [location]
at [time]
[frequency].

Example:
Insight: Environment design > willpower

Vague action: "Make reading easier"

Specific action:
"I will place my current book on my pillow
in my bedroom
every morning after making my bed
daily.

Expected result: Visual cue triggers evening reading"
```

**Step 3: Implementation Tracking**
```json
{
  "insightId": "env-design-habit",
  "action": "Place book on pillow daily",
  "startDate": "2025-01-15",
  "frequency": "daily",
  "trackingMethod": "checkmark",
  "successMetric": "Read 5+ nights per week",
  "results": [
    {"date": "2025-01-15", "completed": true, "notes": "Worked great"},
    {"date": "2025-01-16", "completed": true},
    {"date": "2025-01-17", "completed": false, "notes": "Forgot to place book"}
  ],
  "effectiveness": {
    "week1": 6/7,
    "week2": 7/7,
    "week3": 7/7,
    "trend": "improving"
  },
  "evaluation": "Keep doing - effective cue",
  "relatedBook": "Atomic Habits"
}
```

#### Application by Book Type

**Non-Fiction: Knowledge Application**
```
For each book, extract 1-3 applications:

Business/Productivity:
- Identify 1 process to improve
- Implement 1 framework
- Change 1 behavior

Psychology/Self-help:
- Try 1 mental model
- Practice 1 technique
- Shift 1 perspective

Science/Technical:
- Apply 1 concept to work
- Explain 1 idea to someone
- Use 1 tool/method

Example (Deep Work):
1. Schedule: Block 9am-12pm for deep work daily
2. Environment: Remove phone from office during blocks
3. Ritual: 5-min shutdown routine at end of work day

Track for 30 days, assess effectiveness
```

**Fiction: Perspective Application**
```
Fiction provides mental models and emotional intelligence:

Character lessons:
- How did protagonist overcome challenge?
- What would I do differently?
- What trait can I emulate?

Thematic lessons:
- How does theme apply to my life?
- What did I learn about human nature?
- How can this change my perspective?

Example (To Kill a Mockingbird):
Lesson: "You never really understand a person until you consider
things from his point of view"

Application:
- Before judging colleague's decision, ask about their constraints
- In disagreements, articulate other person's perspective first
- Practice empathy daily
```

#### Habit Formation from Reading

**Build Reading-Related Habits**

**Habit 1: Daily Reading Time**
```
Habit Stack (from Atomic Habits):

After [current habit],
I will [new habit].

Examples:
- After I pour my morning coffee, I will read for 15 minutes
- After I eat dinner, I will read for 30 minutes
- After I get in bed, I will read until my eyes get heavy

Choose existing habit as trigger
Link reading to it
Track consistency
```

**Habit 2: Note-Taking Practice**
```
Implementation:

Trigger: Whenever I finish a chapter
Behavior: Write 2-3 sentence summary
Reward: Check off chapter on reading list

Or:

Trigger: Whenever something resonates
Behavior: Add highlight + brief note
Reward: Satisfaction of capturing insight

Make it easy:
- Keep notebook/phone handy
- Use simple system
- Don't overthink
```

**Habit 3: Regular Review**
```
Weekly Review Routine:

When: Sunday evening, 7pm
Where: Desk with notebook
Duration: 15 minutes

Process:
1. Review current book progress (2 min)
2. Read 2 old book summaries (5 min)
3. Identify 1 insight to apply this week (3 min)
4. Update reading goals/stats (5 min)

Reward:
- Feel of progress
- Cup of tea during review
- Satisfaction of completed ritual
```
