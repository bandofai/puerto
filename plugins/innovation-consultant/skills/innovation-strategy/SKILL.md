# Innovation Strategy Skill

Comprehensive frameworks and patterns for innovation strategy development, portfolio management, and success measurement.

## Innovation Frameworks

### Doblin 10 Types of Innovation

**Finance**:
1. **Profit Model**: How you make money (pricing, revenue streams)
2. **Network**: Connections with others to create value
3. **Structure**: Alignment of talent and assets

**Process**:
4. **Process**: Signature or superior methods
5. **Product Performance**: Distinguishing features and functionality
6. **Product System**: Complementary products and services

**Delivery**:
7. **Service**: Support and enhancements that surround offerings
8. **Channel**: How offerings are delivered to customers
9. **Brand**: Representation of your offerings and business
10. **Customer Engagement**: Interactions you foster

**Usage**: Categorize innovation opportunities across all 10 types, not just product innovation.

### Three Horizons Framework

**Horizon 1 (Extend & Defend)**:
- **Timeframe**: 0-12 months
- **Focus**: Core business optimization
- **Risk**: Low
- **Return**: Incremental improvement
- **Resource Allocation**: 70% of innovation budget
- **Examples**: Feature improvements, cost reduction, efficiency gains

**Horizon 2 (Build & Grow)**:
- **Timeframe**: 1-3 years
- **Focus**: Emerging opportunities
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Return**: Significant growth
- **Resource Allocation**: 20% of innovation budget
- **Examples**: New markets, adjacent products, business model variations

**Horizon 3 (Create & Transform)**:
- **Timeframe**: 3-10 years
- **Focus**: Future possibilities
- **Risk**: High
- **Return**: Transformational
- **Resource Allocation**: 10% of innovation budget
- **Examples**: Breakthrough innovations, new industries, disruptive technologies

**Portfolio Balance**: Manage innovation investments across all three horizons to balance short-term stability with long-term growth.

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework

**Core Concept**: Customers "hire" products/services to get a job done.

**Job Anatomy**:
- **Functional Job**: Task to be completed (drill a hole)
- **Emotional Job**: How customer wants to feel (feel competent)
- **Social Job**: How customer wants to be perceived (be seen as handy)

**Job Statement Format**:
```
When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].
```

**Examples**:
- When I'm hungry at lunch, I want to eat something quickly, so I can get back to work without disrupting my day
- When I'm moving houses, I want to transport fragile items safely, so I can preserve valuable possessions

**Outcome Expectations**:
- **Speed**: Minimize time
- **Stability**: Minimize variability
- **Output**: Maximize quality
- **Cost**: Minimize expense

**Usage**: Interview customers to uncover the true "job" they're trying to accomplish, revealing innovation opportunities.
