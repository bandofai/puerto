# Go-to-Market Strategy Skill

**Strategic product launch planning with proven frameworks for positioning, launch execution, and measuring success**

This skill codifies best practices from successful product launches at B2B and B2C companies.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Customer-Centric**: Start with customer problems, not product features
2. **Multi-Channel**: Coordinate across all customer touchpoints
3. **Data-Driven**: Set clear metrics and track rigorously
4. **Cross-Functional**: Align product, marketing, sales, and success teams
5. **Iterative**: Launch, learn, refine, repeat

---

## GTM Planning Framework

### 1. Market Understanding

**Market Sizing**:
- **TAM** (Total Addressable Market): Total revenue if 100% market share
- **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market): Portion you can actually serve
- **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market): Realistic market share (1-3 years)

**Example**:
```
TAM: $50B (all project management software globally)
SAM: $5B (cloud-based, SMB-focused, English-speaking markets)
SOM: $50M (realistic share with our positioning and resources)
```

**Competitive Landscape**:
- **Direct competitors**: Same solution to same problem
- **Indirect competitors**: Different solution to same problem
- **Substitutes**: Current workarounds (spreadsheets, email, etc.)

**Competitive Analysis Table**:
| Factor | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B | Substitute |
|--------|----|--------------|--------------| ------------|
| Price | $29/mo | $49/mo | $19/mo | Free (Excel) |
| Ease of Use | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Features | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
| Support | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐ |

**Customer Insights**:
- Pain points (what frustrates them today?)
- Jobs to be done (what are they trying to accomplish?)
- Buying triggers (what causes them to seek solution?)
- Decision criteria (how do they evaluate options?)
- Buying process (who's involved, how long, budget?)

---

### 2. Positioning & Messaging

#### Positioning Statement Template

```
For [target customer]
Who [customer need/opportunity]
[Product name] is a [market category]
That [key benefit/value proposition]

Unlike [primary competitive alternative]
Our product [primary differentiation]
```

**Example**:
```
For small marketing teams
Who struggle to create professional graphics without a designer
Canva is an online design platform
That makes it easy to create stunning designs with drag-and-drop templates

Unlike traditional design tools like Photoshop
Our product requires no design skills and can be learned in minutes
```

#### Value Proposition Canvas

**Customer Jobs**:
- Functional: What task are they trying to complete?
- Social: How do they want to be perceived?
- Emotional: How do they want to feel?

**Customer Pains**:
- What frustrates them?
- What costs too much time/money?
- What risks do they face?

**Customer Gains**:
- What would make their job easier?
- What positive outcomes do they seek?
- What would delight them?

**Pain Relievers** (How your product helps):
- Saves time
- Reduces cost
- Eliminates risk
- Removes friction

**Gain Creators** (How your product creates value):
- Enables new capabilities
- Improves quality
- Increases efficiency
- Provides peace of mind

#### Message Hierarchy

**Level 1: Primary Message (Elevator Pitch)**
One sentence that captures core value

Example: "Project management that your team will actually use"

**Level 2: Supporting Messages (3-5 Key Points)**
Main reasons to believe

Example:
1. Set up in 5 minutes, no training required
2. Visual boards that everyone understands
3. All your tools integrated in one place
4. Flexible enough for any team's workflow
5. Trusted by 50,000+ teams worldwide

**Level 3: Proof Points**
Data, testimonials, case studies for each supporting message

Example for Point 1:
- "93% of users complete setup in under 10 minutes"
- Testimonial: "We had the whole team onboarded before lunch" - Sarah K, Marketing Manager
- Video: 3-minute onboarding walkthrough

#### Messaging by Audience

**Executive Buyer** (Cares about ROI, strategic value):
- "Reduce project delays by 40%, saving $200K annually"
- "Strategic visibility into all initiatives across the organization"
- "30-day ROI with minimal implementation risk"

**End User** (Cares about daily experience):
- "Know exactly what to work on next, no confusion"
- "Update status in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes"
- "Stay in the loop without endless meetings"

**Technical Buyer** (Cares about security, integration, scalability):
- "Enterprise-grade security (SOC 2, GDPR compliant)"
- "APIs and 100+ integrations with your existing tools"
- "Scales from 5 to 5,000 users with no performance degradation"

**Economic Buyer** (Cares about cost, budget):
- "$10 per user vs $30-50 for enterprise tools"
- "No implementation fees or hidden costs"
- "Month-to-month, cancel anytime (but no one does)"
