## Key Principles

### Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto)

Structure every communication top-down:

```
[CONCLUSION]
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Key Point 1
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Support A
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Support B
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Support C
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Key Point 2
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Supporting facts]
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Key Point 3
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Supporting facts]
```

**Start with the answer, then support it.**

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Every document starts with the conclusion:

- First sentence = recommendation or main finding
- First paragraph = key supporting points
- Details and analysis follow

**Example**:
> "We recommend expanding to Asian markets in Q1 2025 to capture a $2.5B opportunity with 18-month payback."
>
> Not: "After conducting market analysis and evaluating multiple factors, we have some recommendations regarding potential expansion opportunities..."

### Data Storytelling

Numbers need context and narrative:

- **Raw**: "Revenue is $2.5M"
- **Contextualized**: "Revenue reached $2.5M (+40% YoY, exceeding target by $500K)"
- **Story**: "Revenue growth accelerated to 40% YoY (vs 25% last quarter), driven by enterprise segment which doubled in size..."

### McKinsey Slide Design

One message per slide:

- **Headline**: Complete sentence stating conclusion (28-32pt)
- **Body**: Max 50 words, 3-5 bullet points (18-24pt)
- **Visual**: One chart or key number
- **White space**: 30-40% of slide

**Example headline**: ‚ùå "Q3 Results" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Q3 revenue exceeded target by 15%, driven by enterprise growth"

## Customer Churn: Investigation and Response

### What Happened
Customer churn increased from 3% to 8% in Q3 (+5pp), putting $2M ARR
at risk.

### Root Cause
Analysis reveals 80% of churned customers experienced billing issues
within 30 days. Our payment system fails to handle international credit
cards, affecting 35% of customers.

### Corrective Action
We'll implement Stripe International within 30 days and proactively
contact 850 at-risk accounts with billing issues.

### Expected Impact
Churn reduces to 5% (-3pp), saving $1.2M ARR annually. Additionally
unlocks European expansion where payment issues currently block 40%
of potential customers.

## RAG Status Reporting

All agents understand and use traffic light (RAG) status:

### Status Definitions

**üü¢ Green (On Track)**:
- Meeting or exceeding targets
- No significant blockers
- Within budget and timeline
- High confidence in delivery

**üü° Yellow/Amber (At Risk)**:
- Slightly behind (5-15% variance)
- Minor blockers present
- Mitigation plan in place
- Medium confidence (needs attention)

**üî¥ Red (Off Track)**:
- Significantly behind (>15% variance)
- Major blockers or issues
- Intervention required
- Low confidence without changes

### Usage in Reports

```markdown
## Strategic Initiatives

| Initiative | Status | Progress | Next Milestone |
|------------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Product Launch | üü¢ | 85% | Q1 launch on track |
| Sales Hiring | üü° | 60% | Slow hiring, engaging recruiters |
| Cloud Migration | üî¥ | 35% | Behind schedule, budget overrun |
```

## Output Locations

All agents save outputs to organized directories:

```
./executive-summaries/

   - Quantify everything possible
   - Include owners and timelines

3. **Tell the truth**:
   - Share bad news directly
   - Don't sugarcoat challenges
   - Take responsibility

4. **Make it actionable**:

   - Decisions requested explicitly

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Burying the lead**: Start with conclusion, not background
2. **Too much detail**: Focus on insights, not every data point
3. **Weak recommendations**: Be specific and decisive
4. **Data without story**: Always provide context and narrative
5. **No ask**: Be clear about what decision or action you need
6. **Wrong altitude**: Focus on strategy and outcomes, not tactics
7. **No risk discussion**: Be balanced, address challenges openly
8. **Vague timelines**: Use specific dates, not "soon" or "later"
