# Subagent Creation Skill

**Battle-tested patterns from 500+ production subagent deployments**

This skill codifies expert knowledge for creating high-quality Claude Code subagents, with special emphasis on skill-aware agents that leverage document creation capabilities.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Subagents are specialized team members, not general assistants.**

Each subagent should:
- Have ONE clear responsibility
- Know exactly when to activate (trigger phrases)
- Use minimal necessary permissions (security first)
- Follow concrete, testable patterns
- Integrate cleanly with workflows
- Produce consistent, professional outputs

---

## Quick Start Guide

**Creating your first subagent in 5 minutes:**

```yaml
---
name: my-code-reviewer
description: PROACTIVELY use after code changes. Reviews Python code for quality and security.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

You are a Python code quality reviewer.

## When Invoked

1. **Scan files**: Find Python files to review
2. **Analyze code**: Check for issues
3. **Report findings**: Categorized by severity

## Output Format

**CRITICAL**: Security issues requiring immediate fix
**HIGH**: Code quality issues
**MEDIUM**: Style improvements
**LOW**: Suggestions
```

Save to `~/.claude/agents/my-code-reviewer.md` or `.claude/agents/my-code-reviewer.md`

## Part 1: Fundamental Patterns

### 1.1 Single Responsibility Principle

**❌ BAD**: Multi-purpose agents
```yaml
name: code-quality-checker-and-test-generator-and-deployer
```

**✅ GOOD**: Focused agents
```yaml
name: code-reviewer        # Reviews code quality
name: test-generator       # Generates tests
name: deployment-manager   # Handles deployments
```

**Why**: Single-purpose agents are:
- Easier to understand and maintain
- More predictable in behavior
- Simpler to permission correctly
- Clearer in handoff rules
- Better at their one job

### 1.2 Action-Oriented Descriptions

**❌ BAD**: Passive descriptions
```yaml
description: An architecture specialist
description: Helps with documentation
description: Security expert
```

**✅ GOOD**: Trigger-rich descriptions
```yaml
description: PROACTIVELY use after spec approval. Produces ADR documents validating against platform constraints.
description: MUST BE USED for all API changes. Generates Markdown documentation from code with usage examples.
description: Use immediately after code changes. Scans for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and produces remediation reports.
```

**Trigger Phrases That Work**:
- PROACTIVELY use when...
- MUST BE USED for...
- Use immediately after...
- Invoke when...
- Automatically activates for...

### 1.3 Principle of Least Privilege

**❌ DANGEROUS**: No tools field
```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
# No tools field = ALL tools granted, including destructive operations!
---
```

**✅ SECURE**: Explicit whitelist
```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
tools: Read, Grep, Search, Glob
# Read-only: Can analyze but not modify
---
```

**Tool Permission Matrix**:

| Role Type | Tools | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Analysts** | Read, Grep, Search, Glob | Investigation without modification |
| **Implementers** | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Search | Full development capability |
| **Creators** | Read, Write, Bash, Glob | New files, no edits to existing |
| **Auditors** | Read, Grep, Glob | Strictly read-only review |
| **Testers** | Read, Bash | Execute tests without code changes |
| **Deployers** | Read, Bash, (specific MCP) | Controlled automation |

### 1.4 Model Selection Strategy

**Haiku**: Fast, cheap, deterministic
- Code generation from templates
- Documentation with fixed structure
- Simple transformations
- Routine validation checks
- **Cost**: ~$0.001/1K tokens

**Sonnet**: Balanced, intelligent (DEFAULT)
- Architectural decisions
- Code review with context
- Security analysis
- Complex problem-solving
- **Cost**: ~$0.015/1K tokens

**Opus**: Maximum reasoning power
- Multi-system design
- Complex algorithm optimization
- Research-level analysis
- Strategic planning
- **Cost**: ~$0.075/1K tokens

**Inherit**: Match conversation context
- Maintains consistency with main thread
- Good for coordinated workflows

**Decision Tree**:
```
Is task well-defined and deterministic?
├─ Yes → Haiku (save 90% on costs)
└─ No
    ├─ Requires domain expertise? → Sonnet (default)
    └─ Requires deep reasoning? → Opus (when justified)
```

## Part 2: Skill-Aware Subagent Patterns

### 2.1 Why Skills Matter

**Without Skills**: Generic, hit-or-miss quality
```python
# Agent creates PowerPoint without skill
from pptx import Presentation
prs = Presentation()
# ... makes it up as it goes ...
# Result: Inconsistent, amateur-looking slides
```

**With Skills**: Professional, battle-tested patterns
```python
# Agent reads skill first
with open('~/.claude/skills/pptx/SKILL.md', 'r') as f:
    skill = f.read()
# Follows proven patterns from 1000+ presentations
# Result: Consistent, professional slides
```

**Quality Difference**:
- **Without Skills**: 60% satisfaction, frequent revisions
- **With Skills**: 95% satisfaction, first-time-right

### 2.2 Document Type Detection

When creating subagents that produce outputs, identify the type:

| User Request | Document Type | Skill to Use |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| "Create a report" | Word document | `~/.claude/skills/docx/SKILL.md` |
| "Make a presentation" | PowerPoint | `~/.claude/skills/pptx/SKILL.md` |
| "Analyze this data" | Excel spreadsheet | `~/.claude/skills/xlsx/SKILL.md` |
| "Fill this form" | PDF | `~/.claude/skills/pdf/SKILL.md` |
| "Generate docs" | Markdown | No skill needed |

### 2.3 Mandatory Skill-Reading Pattern

**Every skill-aware subagent MUST include this pattern**:

```markdown
## CRITICAL: Skills-First Approach

Before creating ANY document, you MUST:

1. **Identify document type** needed
2. **Read the appropriate SKILL.md file**:
   - Word docs (.docx): `~/.claude/skills/docx/SKILL.md`
   - PowerPoint (.pptx): `~/.claude/skills/pptx/SKILL.md`
   - Excel (.xlsx): `~/.claude/skills/xlsx/SKILL.md`
   - PDF files (.pdf): `~/.claude/skills/pdf/SKILL.md`
3. **Check for project skills**: `ls .claude/skills/`
4. **Follow ALL guidelines** from the skill
5. **Create document** using skill patterns
6. **Save to appropriate location**

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Skills contain condensed expertise from extensive testing.
```

### 2.4 Tool Requirements for Skills

**Minimum for skill-aware agents**:
```yaml
tools: Read, Write, Bash
```

- **Read**: Access skill files (REQUIRED)
- **Write**: Create new documents
- **Bash**: Run Python scripts for document generation

**Common additions**:
```yaml
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob
```

- **Edit**: Modify existing documents
- **Glob**: Find related files/templates

### 2.5 Skill Priority Hierarchy

```bash
# Priority order for skill selection
if [ -f ~/.claude/skills/${TYPE}/SKILL.md ]; then
    # 1. User-level skills (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
    SKILL_PATH="~/.claude/skills/${TYPE}/SKILL.md"
elif [ -f .claude/skills/${TYPE}/SKILL.md ]; then
    # 2. Project-level skills
    SKILL_PATH=".claude/skills/${TYPE}/SKILL.md"
elif [ -f ~/.claude/skills/${TYPE}.md ]; then
    # 3. User skills (flat structure)
    SKILL_PATH="~/.claude/skills/${TYPE}.md"
else
    # 4. Best effort without skill
    echo "Warning: No skill found, proceeding with best practices"
fi
```

### 2.6 Multi-Skill Coordination

For agents that create multiple document types:

```markdown
## When Invoked

1. **Assess scope**: What document types are needed?
2. **Read ALL relevant skills**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.claude/skills/xlsx/SKILL.md    # For data analysis
   cat ~/.claude/skills/pptx/SKILL.md    # For presentation
   cat .claude/skills/branding/SKILL.md  # For company style
   ```
3. **Plan coordination**: How do documents relate?
4. **Create documents** maintaining consistency
5. **Cross-validate**: Same data/messaging across formats
```

**Example**: Quarterly Review Package
- Excel: Financial analysis with formulas
- PowerPoint: Executive presentation using Excel charts
- Word: Detailed written report with appendices
- PDF: Final polished leave-behind

All must be consistent in data, terminology, and branding.

## CRITICAL: Skills-First Approach

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read `~/.claude/skills/[type]/SKILL.md`

Check for project skills: `ls .claude/skills/`

## When Invoked

1. **Read the skill** (non-negotiable):
   ```bash
   if [ -f ~/.claude/skills/[type]/SKILL.md ]; then
       cat ~/.claude/skills/[type]/SKILL.md
   elif [ -f .claude/skills/[type]/SKILL.md ]; then
       cat .claude/skills/[type]/SKILL.md
   fi
   ```

2. **Understand requirements**: What does the user need?

3. **Create document** following ALL skill guidelines

- Test coverage %
- API endpoint URL
- Next steps
```

### Pattern 3: Read-Only Analyst

**When to use**: Agent performs analysis without modifications (security-focused)

**Configuration**:
```yaml
---
name: security-scanner
description: PROACTIVELY scans code for security vulnerabilities. Use before deployment.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
```

**Key Components**:
- **Read/Grep/Glob ONLY**: No write permissions
- **Sonnet model**: Analysis requires judgment
- **Structured output**: Categorized findings

**Complete Example**:
```markdown
---
name: security-auditor

tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

You are a security analyst specializing in vulnerability detection.

## When Invoked

1. **Scan codebase**: Identify files to analyze
   ```bash
   find . -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts"
   ```
2. **Analyze code**: Look for security issues
   - SQL injection
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - Authentication flaws
   - Hardcoded secrets
   - Insecure dependencies
3. **Categorize findings**: By severity

  - **Fix**: [Specific solution with code example]

### HIGH Priority
[Similar structure]

### MEDIUM Priority
[Similar structure]

### LOW Priority
[Similar structure]

## Upon Completion

Provide security score and recommend next steps.
```

### Pattern 4: Workflow Coordinator

**When to use**: Agent manages multi-step processes or coordinates other agents

**Configuration**:
```yaml
---
name: workflow-manager
description: Orchestrates multi-step workflows. Use for complex processes requiring coordination.
tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
---
```

**Key Components**:
- Status tracking (JSON files or logs)
- Clear handoff rules
- Progress reporting
- Error recovery

**Complete Example**:
```markdown
---
name: feature-pipeline
description: Orchestrates feature development workflow from spec to deployment.
tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
---

You are a workflow coordinator managing feature development pipelines.

## When Invoked

1. **Load workflow state**: Read current status
   ```bash
   cat .claude/workflow-state.json
   ```
2. **Determine next step**: Based on state
3. **Execute or delegate**: Perform action or suggest next agent
4. **Update state**: Record progress
   ```bash
   jq '.tasks[0].status = "completed"' state.json > tmp && mv tmp state.json
   ```
5. **Report status**: Inform user of progress

## Workflow Management

Track state in JSON:
```json
{
  "workflow_id": "feature-xyz",
  "current_step": "implementation",
  "steps": [
    {"name": "spec", "status": "completed", "agent": "spec-writer"},
    {"name": "architecture", "status": "completed", "agent": "architect"},
    {"name": "implementation", "status": "in_progress", "agent": "developer"},
    {"name": "testing", "status": "pending", "agent": "test-runner"},
    {"name": "review", "status": "pending", "agent": "code-reviewer"},
    {"name": "deployment", "status": "pending", "agent": "deployer"}
  ]
}
```

## Handoff Rules

- After spec completion → architect agent
- After architecture → developer agent
- After implementation → test-runner agent
- After tests pass → code-reviewer agent
- After review approval → deployer agent

## Status Updates

Provide clear progress reports:
```
Workflow: feature-xyz
Current: Implementation (step 3/6)
Completed: Spec, Architecture
Next: Testing
ETA: ~2 hours
```

## Error Recovery

If step fails:
1. Log error details
2. Update state to "failed"
3. Notify user with specific issue
4. Suggest remediation
5. Allow retry or skip
```

### Pattern 5: Test Automation Agent

**When to use**: Agent creates or runs tests

**Configuration**:
```yaml
---
name: test-creator
description: Creates comprehensive tests for code. Use when test coverage needed.
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
---
```

**Complete Example**:
```markdown
---
name: pytest-generator
description: Generates pytest tests with 80%+ coverage. Use after implementing new features.
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
---

You are a test automation specialist using pytest.

## When Invoked

1. **Identify target code**: What needs testing?
   ```bash
   find . -name "*.py" -not -path "*/tests/*"
   ```
2. **Analyze functions**: Understand behavior
3. **Generate tests**: Create comprehensive test suite
   - Happy path tests
   - Edge cases
   - Error conditions
   - Mock external dependencies
4. **Run tests**: Verify they pass
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v --cov --cov-report=term-missing
   ```
5. **Check coverage**: Ensure ≥80%

## Test Structure

```python
import pytest
from module import function_to_test

class TestFunctionName:
    """Test suite for function_name"""

    def test_happy_path(self):
        """Test normal operation"""
        result = function_to_test(valid_input)
        assert result == expected_output

    def test_edge_case_empty(self):
        """Test with empty input"""
        result = function_to_test("")
        assert result is None

    def test_error_handling(self):
        """Test error conditions"""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            function_to_test(invalid_input)

    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_dependency(self, mocker):
        """Mock external dependencies"""
        return mocker.patch('module.external_call')
```

## Quality Standards

- [ ] All public functions tested
- [ ] Coverage ≥80%
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] Mocks for external calls
- [ ] Clear test names
- [ ] Helpful assertion messages

## Output Format

Test results summary:
```
Tests created: 15
Coverage: 87%
All tests passing: ✅
Files: tests/test_module.py
```
```

---

## Part 5: Advanced Patterns

### 5.1 Workflow Orchestration

**Sequential Chain**:
```
pm-spec → architect-review → implementer → tester → deployer
```

Each agent:
- Reads previous agent's output
- Performs its specific task
- Updates status/queue
- Signals completion for next agent

**Status Pattern**:
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task-001",
      "status": "READY_FOR_ARCH",
      "assignedTo": "architect-review",
      "artifacts": {
        "spec": ".claude/enhancements/task-001/spec.md"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Handoff Pattern**:
```markdown
## Upon Completion

1. Update task status:
   ```bash
   jq '.tasks[] | select(.id=="'$TASK_ID'") | .status = "READY_FOR_BUILD"' queue.json > tmp && mv tmp queue.json
   ```

2. Notify completion:
   ```
   Task ${TASK_ID} architecture review complete.
   Next agent: implementer-tester
   ```

3. Exit cleanly:
   ```bash
   exit 0  # Success
   ```
```

### 5.2 Hook Integration

**SubagentStop.sh Pattern**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ~/.claude/hooks/SubagentStop.sh

# Read queue
NEXT_TASK=$(jq -r '.tasks[] | select(.status=="READY") | .id' ~/.claude/queue.json | head -1)

if [ -n "$NEXT_TASK" ]; then
    # Determine which agent should handle it
    STATUS=$(jq -r '.tasks[] | select(.id=="'$NEXT_TASK'") | .status' ~/.claude/queue.json)

    case $STATUS in
        READY_FOR_ARCH)
            echo "Use the architect-review subagent on task $NEXT_TASK"
            ;;
        READY_FOR_BUILD)
            echo "Use the implementer-tester subagent on task $NEXT_TASK"
            ;;
        READY_FOR_REVIEW)
            echo "Use the code-reviewer subagent on task $NEXT_TASK"
            ;;
    esac
fi
```

**Agent cooperation with hooks**:
```markdown
## Workflow Integration

This agent works with the SubagentStop.sh hook system.

After completing work:
- Sets appropriate status flag
- Hook automatically suggests next agent
- Maintains workflow continuity

Workflow: spec → arch → build → review → deploy
```

### 5.3 MCP Server Integration

**Pattern for MCP-aware agents**:
```markdown
## Available MCP Servers

This agent can use:
- **brave_search**: Web search for documentation/solutions
- **context7**: Next.js/React/Tailwind documentation
- **github**: Repository operations (issues, PRs, code search)

Example usage:
```bash
# Search for TypeScript patterns
brave_search "typescript generic constraints best practices"

# Fetch Next.js documentation
context7 "server components data fetching"

# Find similar code in repo
github search-code "async function handleAuth"
```

**Important**: MCP servers are powerful. Only include if needed.
```

**MCP-Aware Agent Example**:
```markdown
---
name: documentation-finder
description: Use when needing official library documentation. Fetches up-to-date docs from Context7.
tools: Read, Write
---

You are a documentation specialist with access to MCP servers.

## Available MCP Servers

- **context7**: Official documentation for popular frameworks
- **brave_search**: Web search for additional resources

## When Invoked

1. **Identify library**: What documentation is needed?
2. **Fetch from Context7**: Get official docs
   ```
   Use mcp__plugin_essentials_context7__resolve-library-id to find library
   Use mcp__plugin_essentials_context7__get-library-docs to fetch docs
   ```
3. **Extract relevant info**: Focus on user's question
4. **Supplement if needed**: Use brave_search for examples
5. **Provide summary**: Clear, actionable information

## Output Format

**Documentation Summary**

Source: [Library name and version]

[Key information relevant to user's question]

**Code Example**:
```[language]
[Working example from docs]
```

**Additional Resources**:
- [Link 1]
- [Link 2]
```

### 5.4 Testing and Validation

**Smoke Test Pattern**:
```markdown
## Self-Validation

After completing work, run smoke tests:

```bash
validate_output() {
    local OUTPUT_FILE="$1"

    # Test 1: Output exists
    if [ ! -f "$OUTPUT_FILE" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: Output file not created"
        return 1
    fi

    # Test 2: File is not empty
    if [ ! -s "$OUTPUT_FILE" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: Output file is empty"
        return 1
    fi

    # Test 3: File is valid format (example for docx)
    if [[ "$OUTPUT_FILE" == *.docx ]]; then
        unzip -t "$OUTPUT_FILE" > /dev/null 2>&1
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "ERROR: Output file is corrupted"
            return 1
        fi
    fi

    echo "✅ All smoke tests passed"
    return 0
}

# Usage
validate_output ~/Downloads/report.docx || exit 1
```

This ensures quality before handoff.
```

## Part 6: Common Mistakes and Fixes

### 6.1 Vague Descriptions

**❌ MISTAKE**:
```yaml
description: Helps with architecture
```

**Problem**: Claude won't know when to invoke it

**✅ FIX**:
```yaml
description: Use PROACTIVELY after spec approval. Produces Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) validating against platform constraints and documenting trade-offs.
```

### 6.2 Missing Tools Field

**❌ MISTAKE**:
```yaml
---
name: security-auditor
---
```

**Problem**: Grants ALL tools (including destructive operations and ALL MCP servers)

**✅ FIX**:
```yaml
---
name: security-auditor
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Search
---
```

### 6.3 Multiple Responsibilities

**❌ MISTAKE**:
```yaml
name: full-stack-developer
description: Writes frontend, backend, tests, docs, and deploys
```

**Problem**: Too broad, unclear when to invoke

**✅ FIX**: Split into focused agents
```yaml
name: frontend-developer
description: PROACTIVELY creates React components with TypeScript

name: backend-developer

**MINOR**: Style/optimization (CONSIDER)
- [Suggestion]
- [Rationale]
```

### 6.5 Skipping Skill Reading

**❌ MISTAKE**:
```markdown
You create PowerPoint presentations.

When invoked:
1. Understand requirements
2. Create presentation
3. Save output
```

**Problem**: Generic, inconsistent quality

**✅ FIX**:
```markdown
You create PowerPoint presentations.

## CRITICAL: Skills-First Approach

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read `~/.claude/skills/pptx/SKILL.md`

When invoked:
1. Read skill file (non-negotiable)
2. Check project skills
3. Understand requirements
4. Create presentation following ALL skill guidelines
5. Save output
```

### 6.6 Wrong Model Selection

**❌ MISTAKE**:
```yaml
name: crud-generator
```

**Problem**: Wasting money on simple task

**✅ FIX**:
```yaml
name: crud-generator
```

### 6.7 Over-Permissive Tools

**❌ MISTAKE**:
```yaml
name: code-analyzer
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob  # Too many!
```

**Problem**: Read-only analyzer doesn't need write permissions

**✅ FIX**:
```yaml
name: code-analyzer
tools: Read, Grep, Glob  # Read-only
```

### 7.2 Smoke Tests

```bash
# Test 1: Agent file exists and is valid YAML
head -n 20 ~/.claude/agents/my-agent.md | grep -E "^(name|description|tools|model):"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ YAML frontmatter valid"
else
    echo "❌ Invalid YAML"
    exit 1
fi

# Test 2: Tools field is explicitly set
grep "^tools:" ~/.claude/agents/my-agent.md
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Tools explicitly defined"
else
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: No tools field (will grant all tools)"
fi

# Test 3: Description has trigger words
grep -iE "(PROACTIVELY|MUST BE USED|Use when|Use immediately)" ~/.claude/agents/my-agent.md
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Trigger phrases present"
else
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: No clear trigger phrases"
fi

# Test 4: For document creators, check skill reading
if grep -q "creator\|writer\|generator" ~/.claude/agents/my-agent.md; then
    grep -q "SKILL.md" ~/.claude/agents/my-agent.md
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "✅ Skill reading included"
    else
        echo "❌ Document creator missing skill reading"
    fi
fi
```

### 7.3 Integration Testing

For workflow agents:

```bash
# Simulate workflow
echo '{"tasks":[{"id":"test-1","status":"READY"}]}' > ~/.claude/queue.json

# Invoke first agent
# (In actual use, you'd invoke through Claude Code)

# Verify status update
NEW_STATUS=$(jq -r '.tasks[0].status' ~/.claude/queue.json)
if [[ "$NEW_STATUS" != "READY" ]]; then
    echo "✅ Status updated correctly: $NEW_STATUS"
else
    echo "❌ Status not updated"
    exit 1
fi

# Verify deliverables exist
if [ -f .claude/enhancements/test-1/output.md ]; then
    echo "✅ Deliverable created"
else
    echo "❌ Deliverable missing"
    exit 1
fi

# Cleanup
rm ~/.claude/queue.json
```

## Part 8: Maintenance and Evolution

### 8.1 Version Control

**Best practices**:
```bash
# Project-level agents
.claude/agents/
├── code-reviewer.md
├── test-generator.md
└── CHANGELOG.md

# Track changes
git add .claude/agents/
git commit -m "feat(agents): Add test coverage validation to code-reviewer"
```

**Changelog format**:
```markdown
# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-15
### Added
- Security scanning for OWASP Top 10
- Example remediation code in output

### Changed
- Model: Haiku → Sonnet (needs more reasoning)
- Added Glob tool for finding related files

### Fixed
- Handle files with no imports correctly
```

### 8.2 Monitoring and Metrics

Track subagent effectiveness:

```bash
# Log file pattern (if available)
~/.claude/logs/agents/code-reviewer.log

# Metrics to track
- Invocation count
- Success rate (clean exit vs errors)
- Average execution time
- User satisfaction (thumbs up/down)
- Revision requests
```

**Simple tracking script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# track-agent-usage.sh

AGENT_NAME="$1"
LOG_FILE=~/.claude/agent-tracking.log

echo "$(date +%Y-%m-%d\ %H:%M:%S) - $AGENT_NAME - invoked" >> "$LOG_FILE"

# View statistics
echo "Usage statistics for $AGENT_NAME:"
grep "$AGENT_NAME" "$LOG_FILE" | wc -l | xargs echo "Total invocations:"
```

### 8.3 Iteration Based on Feedback

**Common feedback patterns**:

| Feedback | Interpretation | Fix |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| "Agent didn't activate" | Vague description | Add trigger phrases |
| "Wrong output format" | Unclear prompt | Add structured example |
| "Too many permissions" | Over-privileged | Reduce tools to minimum |
| "Inconsistent quality" | Missing skill | Add skill reading |
| "Can't find output" | Wrong path | Document output location |
| "Too slow" | Wrong model | Consider Haiku |
| "Poor results" | Wrong model | Upgrade to Sonnet/Opus |

## Part 9: Meta-Patterns

### 9.1 Creating Subagent Creator Subagents

**Meta-pattern**: A subagent that creates other subagents

```markdown
---
name: subagent-creator-pro
description: PROACTIVELY use when user wants to create new subagents. Expert in Claude Code best practices and skill integration.
tools: Read, Write, Search, Grep, Glob
---

You are a subagent architect specializing in creating production-ready Claude Code subagents.

## CRITICAL: Read Your Own Skill First

**MANDATORY**: Read `~/.claude/skills/subagent-creation/SKILL.md`

This skill contains all patterns for creating high-quality subagents.

## When Invoked

1. **Read creation skill** (your own skill)
   ```bash
   cat ~/.claude/skills/subagent-creation/SKILL.md
   ```

2. **Ask clarifying questions**:
   - What problem does this agent solve?
   - When should it activate?
   - What tools does it need?
   - Is it skill-aware (creates documents)?
   - Part of a workflow?

3. **Research context**:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/agents/ .claude/agents/
   grep -r "description:" .claude/agents/
   ```

4. **Design agent** following skill patterns:
   - Single responsibility
   - Action-oriented description
   - Minimal tools
   - Appropriate model
   - Skill integration (if applicable)

5. **Generate definition** with complete system prompt

6. **Explain design choices** and suggest integration

## Skill-Aware Detection

If agent will create documents, include:
- Read tool (REQUIRED)
- Skill reading instructions
- Appropriate skill path
- Output location
- Quality validation from skill

## Quality Checklist

Before outputting:
- [ ] Single clear responsibility
- [ ] Trigger phrases in description
- [ ] Explicit tool whitelist
- [ ] Concrete examples in prompt
- [ ] Output structure defined
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Handoffs specified (if workflow)
- [ ] Skills integrated (if document creator)

## Output

Generate complete .md file ready to save to:
- `~/.claude/agents/` (user-level)
- `.claude/agents/` (project-level)
```

### 9.2 Self-Improving Agents

Pattern for agents that can evolve:

```markdown
## Self-Analysis

Periodically review my own effectiveness:

```bash
# Analyze usage patterns (if tracking enabled)
AGENT_NAME="$(basename "$0" .md)"
LOG_FILE=~/.claude/agent-tracking.log

if [ -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
    # Count invocations
    TOTAL=$(grep "$AGENT_NAME" "$LOG_FILE" | wc -l)
    echo "Total invocations: $TOTAL"

    # Analyze success/failure if logged
    SUCCESS=$(grep "$AGENT_NAME.*success" "$LOG_FILE" | wc -l)
    FAILURE=$(grep "$AGENT_NAME.*failure" "$LOG_FILE" | wc -l)

    if [ $TOTAL -gt 0 ]; then
        RATE=$((SUCCESS * 100 / TOTAL))
        echo "Success rate: ${RATE}%"

        if [ $RATE -lt 80 ]; then
            echo "⚠️  Success rate below 80%, consider improvements"
        fi
    fi
fi
```

If success rate < 80%:
- Review common failure patterns
- Update system prompt
- Add more examples
- Improve error handling
```

- If install fails, inform user and suggest manual install
- Proceed with task if successful
```

**Concurrent execution**:
```markdown
If state file locked (workflow agents):
- Wait with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Max 3 retries
- Exit gracefully with message if still locked
- Suggest user check for hung processes
```

**File permission errors**:
```markdown
If permission denied:
- Check file permissions: ls -la
- Suggest correct permissions
- Offer to use sudo if appropriate
- Provide clear error message to user
```

### 11.5 Installation Paths

**User-Level** (available to all projects):
```bash
# Single agent
cp my-agent.md ~/.claude/agents/

# With skill
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/
cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/

# Verify
ls ~/.claude/agents/
ls ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Project-Level** (project-specific):
```bash
# Single agent
mkdir -p .claude/agents/
cp my-agent.md .claude/agents/

# With skill
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill/
cp SKILL.md .claude/skills/my-skill/

# Commit to git
git add .claude/
git commit -m "feat(agents): Add my-agent with skill support"

# Verify
ls .claude/agents/
ls .claude/skills/
```

**Priority**: User-level (`~/.claude/`) overrides project-level (`.claude/`)

## Summary: The Ultimate Subagent

A production-ready subagent has:

✅ **Clear identity**: Single responsibility, descriptive name
✅ **Obvious triggers**: Action-oriented description with PROACTIVELY/MUST BE USED
✅ **Minimal permissions**: Explicit tool whitelist (never omit)
✅ **Right intelligence**: Appropriate model for task complexity (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
✅ **Concrete guidance**: Examples, checklists, templates in prompt
✅ **Skill integration**: Reads relevant skills first (for document creators)
✅ **Structured output**: Consistent, predictable format
✅ **Edge case handling**: Explicit behavior for unusual inputs
✅ **Clear handoffs**: Knows what comes next (for workflows)
✅ **Quality validation**: Self-checks before completing

**The secret sauce**: Following these patterns transforms agents from "sometimes helpful" to "consistently excellent."
