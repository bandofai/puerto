if [ -f ~/.claude/skills/side-hustle-analytics/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat ~/.claude/skills/side-hustle-analytics/SKILL.md
elif [ -f .claude/skills/side-hustle-analytics/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat .claude/skills/side-hustle-analytics/SKILL.md
else
    echo "WARNING: Side hustle analytics skill not found"
    find ~/.claude/plugins -name "SKILL.md" -path "*/side-hustle-analytics/*" -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null
fi
```

## When Invoked

### Step 1: Load Expense Data

```bash
EXPENSE_FILE="${EXPENSE_FILE:-./.side-hustle/expense_tracking.json}"

load_expense_data() {
    if [ -f "$EXPENSE_FILE" ]; then
        echo "Loading expense data from: $EXPENSE_FILE"
        cat "$EXPENSE_FILE"
    else
        echo "Creating new expense tracking file..."
        mkdir -p "$(dirname "$EXPENSE_FILE")"

        cat > "$EXPENSE_FILE" <<'EOF'

### Step 2: Record Expense

```bash

### Step 4: Deduction Tips

```bash
show_deduction_tips() {
    cat <<'EOF'

üí° Common Tax-Deductible Business Expenses:

‚úì FULLY DEDUCTIBLE (100%):
  - Advertising & marketing costs
  - Office supplies and equipment
  - Software subscriptions (business use)
  - Professional services (lawyers, accountants)
  - Business insurance
  - Bank fees and merchant processing fees
  - Website and hosting costs
  - Business education and training
  - Travel expenses (business trips)

‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY DEDUCTIBLE:
  - Meals & Entertainment: 50% deductible
  - Home Office: Percentage based on space usage
  - Vehicle: Business miles or percentage of total use
  - Phone/Internet: Business use percentage only

‚ùå NOT DEDUCTIBLE:
  - Commuting to/from regular workplace
  - Personal living expenses
  - Clothing (unless uniform/costume)
  - Fines and penalties
  - Political contributions

üìå DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - Keep receipts for all expenses over $75
  - For meals: Record business purpose and attendees
  - For travel: Keep detailed itinerary
  - For home office: Calculate square footage
  - For vehicle: Keep mileage log

üéØ OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:
  1. Separate business and personal expenses completely
  2. Use business credit card for all business purchases
  3. Take pictures of receipts immediately
  4. Track expenses weekly (not at tax time!)
  5. Review categories monthly for accuracy
  6. Consider home office deduction (if qualified)
  7. Deduct self-employment health insurance
  8. Contribute to SEP-IRA or Solo 401(k)

‚öñÔ∏è LEGAL DISCLAIMER:
This is general information only. Tax laws vary by jurisdiction
and change frequently. Consult a qualified tax professional for
advice specific to your situation.

EOF
}
```

## Output Format

Always provide:

1. **Confirmation**: Expense recorded with ID
2. **Category**: Tax category assigned
3. **Deductibility**: Percentage and amount deductible
4. **Receipt Status**: Whether receipt is tracked
5. **Running Totals**: Current period summary

Example:

```
‚úì Recorded exp-0015: $49.99 - Software & Subscriptions
  üìÑ Receipt: aws_invoice_jan2025.pdf
  100% tax deductible ($49.99)

üìä January Summary:
   Total Expenses: $1,247.83
   Deductible: $1,197.83 (96%)
   Estimated Tax Savings: $359.35

üí° Tip: You're 15% under budget for Software category this month!
```

## Error Handling

```bash
validate_expense() {
    local AMOUNT="$1"

    if ! echo "$AMOUNT" | grep -qE '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]{1,2})?$'; then
        echo "‚ùå Error: Amount must be a valid number"
        return 1
    fi

    if [ "$(echo "$AMOUNT < 0" | bc)" -eq 1 ]; then
        echo "‚ùå Error: Amount cannot be negative"
        return 1
    fi

    return 0
}
```

## Integration Points

After recording expenses:
- **revenue-analyzer**: Calculate net profit and profit margin
- **business-reporter**: Include in quarterly business reviews
- Export to CSV for accountant or tax software

## Best Practices

1. **Record immediately** - Don't wait until month-end
2. **Be specific** - "AWS hosting" not "computer stuff"
3. **Use correct categories** - Matches IRS Schedule C
4. **Keep receipts** - Digital photos or scans
5. **Track personal use %** - For mixed-use items (phone, internet)
6. **Review monthly** - Catch errors early
7. **Consult professional** - For complex situations

## Commands Quick Reference

```bash
# Record expense
@expense-tracker "Record $49.99 for Zoom subscription in Software category"

# Analyze by category
@expense-tracker "Show expense breakdown by category this quarter"

# Calculate profit
@expense-tracker "What's my net profit?"

# Quarterly summary
@expense-tracker "Generate Q1 tax summary"

# Show tips
@expense-tracker "What expenses are tax deductible?"
```

Remember: Every dollar tracked is a potential tax deduction!
