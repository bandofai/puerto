- Time remaining: Deadline - Today
- Pace: Progress per unit time
- Projection: When will goal be reached at current pace?
- Gap analysis: How far ahead/behind schedule?

**Qualitative Metrics**:
- Momentum: Increasing, steady, or decreasing?
- Difficulty: Easier or harder than expected?
- Motivation: High, medium, or low?
- Obstacles: What's blocking progress?
- Learnings: What insights gained?

### Progress Tracking Methods

**Numeric Tracking**:
```
Goal: Save $10,000 by Dec 31
Jan: $1,000 (10% complete)
Feb: $2,200 (22% complete) ↑
Mar: $3,100 (31% complete) ↑
Apr: $4,300 (43% complete) ↑

Current Pace: $1,100/month
Required Pace: $1,000/month
Status: ✅ On track (ahead of schedule)
```

**Streak Tracking**:
```
Goal: Exercise 5 days per week for 12 weeks
Week 1: ✓✓✓✓✓✗✗ (5/7 days) ✅
Week 2: ✓✓✓✓✓✓✗ (6/7 days) ✅
Week 3: ✓✓✓✗✓✓✗ (5/7 days) ✅
Week 4: ✓✓✗✗✗✓✓ (4/7 days) ❌

Current Streak: 2 weeks
Longest Streak: 3 weeks
Success Rate: 75% (meeting goal 3/4 weeks)
```

█████████████░░░░░░░ 67%
```

### Progress Review Cadence

**Daily Check-ins** (1-2 minutes):
- Did I take action today?
- What's one thing I accomplished?
- Any obstacles encountered?

**Weekly Reviews** (15 minutes):
- Progress this week vs. plan
- Metrics update (weight, savings, etc.)
- Adjust strategy if needed
- Plan next week's actions

**Monthly Reviews** (30-60 minutes):
- Overall progress toward deadline
- Are we on track to hit the goal?
- Major wins and obstacles
- Course corrections needed
- Celebrate milestones achieved
- Update projections

**Quarterly Reviews** (1-2 hours):
- Deep dive into progress
- Assess goal relevance (still important?)
- Major strategy adjustments
- Resource allocation review
- Goal modification if needed

### Projection Modeling

**Basic Projection Formula**:
```
Current Amount: $12,000
Target Amount: $30,000
Remaining: $18,000
Current Monthly Rate: $500
Months to Goal: $18,000 / $500 = 36 months

Deadline: 24 months from now
Required Monthly Rate: $18,000 / 24 = $750
Gap: Need $250 more per month
```

**Linear Projection**:
```python
# Assumes constant progress rate
days_elapsed = today - start_date
progress_per_day = current_progress / days_elapsed
days_to_goal = (target - current) / progress_per_day
projected_completion = today + days_to_goal
```

**Accelerated Projection**:
```
Current Pace: $500/month
If increase to $750/month: 24 months (on time)
If increase to $1,000/month: 18 months (6 mo early)
If increase to $1,500/month: 12 months (12 mo early)
```

**Scenarios**:
- **Best Case**: Everything goes perfectly
- **Realistic Case**: Normal progress with minor setbacks
- **Worst Case**: Major obstacles, slower progress

### Progress Analytics

**Velocity Tracking**:
```
Month 1: +$800 (faster than expected)
Month 2: +$1,200 (accelerating!)
Month 3: +$600 (slowing down)
Month 4: +$900 (picking back up)

Average: $875/month
Trend: Slightly above target pace
```

**Consistency Score**:
```
Workout Goal: 5 days per week

Week 1: 5 days ✅ (100%)
Week 2: 6 days ✅ (120%)
Week 3: 4 days ⚠️ (80%)
Week 4: 5 days ✅ (100%)

Consistency Score: 100% (met goal 3/4 weeks)
Average Workouts: 5 per week (on target)
```

**Momentum Indicator**:
- **Positive Momentum**: Progress accelerating, ahead of plan
- **Neutral Momentum**: Steady pace, on track
- **Negative Momentum**: Slowing down, behind schedule

## Goal Review and Adjustment

### When to Review Goals

**Scheduled Reviews**:
- Weekly: Quick progress check
- Monthly: Detailed assessment
- Quarterly: Strategic review
- Annually: Big picture evaluation

**Triggered Reviews**:
- Major life change (job, relationship, health)
- Significant setback or failure
- Unexpected opportunity
- Loss of motivation
- Goal achieved early
- External circumstances change

### Review Questions

**Progress Assessment**:
- Am I on track to hit my deadline?
- What's my completion percentage?
- What's working well?
- What obstacles have I encountered?
- What have I learned so far?

**Relevance Check**:
- Is this goal still important to me?
- Does it align with my current priorities?
- Has my life situation changed?
- Is there a better goal to pursue?
- Am I pursuing this for the right reasons?

**Strategy Evaluation**:
- Is my current approach effective?
- What could I do differently?
- Do I need more/different resources?
- Should I adjust the timeline?
- Do I need more support/accountability?

### Goal Adjustment Strategies

**Timeline Adjustments**:
```
Original: Complete certification by March 31
Reality: Behind schedule due to work travel
Options:
  A. Extend deadline to June 30 (realistic)
  B. Increase study time (3→5 hrs/week)
  C. Pause other goals temporarily
Decision: Extend to June 30, maintain quality
```

**Target Adjustments**:
```
Original: Lose 30 lbs in 6 months
Reality: Losing 1 lb/week (healthy pace)
Options:
  A. Keep goal, extend to 7.5 months
  B. Adjust to 25 lbs in 6 months
  C. Focus on body composition vs weight
Decision: Adjust to 25 lbs, add strength goal
```

**Strategy Pivots**:
```
Original Strategy: Self-study for certification
Challenge: Not making progress, losing motivation
New Strategy:
  - Join study group (accountability)
  - Hire tutor for difficult topics
  - Schedule exam date (commitment)
```

### Goal Modification Matrix

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| On track, goal still relevant | Continue current path |
| Behind schedule, goal important | Adjust timeline or increase effort |
| Ahead of schedule | Increase target or add stretch goal |
| Lost motivation | Revisit "why", adjust approach |
| Life change makes goal impossible | Pause or cancel gracefully |
| Goal no longer relevant | Retire goal, set new one |
| Resources insufficient | Scale down or extend timeline |
| Unexpected opportunity | Pivot to new related goal |

### Retiring Goals Gracefully

**Valid Reasons to Retire a Goal**:
- No longer aligned with values/priorities
- Life circumstances changed significantly
- Discovered it was someone else's goal for you
- Opportunity cost too high
- Found a better alternative path
- Already achieved related outcome differently

**Retirement Process**:
1. **Acknowledge**: "This goal no longer serves me"
2. **Extract Learnings**: What did I learn from the attempt?
3. **Document**: Write brief summary of what happened
4. **Forgive**: Release any guilt or shame
5. **Redirect**: Channel energy to relevant goal
6. **Communicate**: Tell accountability partners

**Retirement Template**:
```
Retired Goal: [Goal description]
Start Date: [When started]
Retirement Date: [Today]
Progress Achieved: [X% or description]
Reason for Retirement:
  [Honest explanation]
Key Learnings:
  - [Learning 1]
  - [Learning 2]
New Focus:
  [Where energy will now go]
```

Level 1: Life Vision (5-10 years)
  ↓
Level 2: Long-term Goals (1-3 years)
  ↓
Level 3: Short-term Goals (3-12 months)
  ↓
Level 4: Milestones (Weekly/Monthly)
  ↓
Level 5: Daily Actions
```

**Example Hierarchy**:
```
Vision: Become a respected engineering leader
  ↓
Long-term: Reach Senior Engineering Manager in 3 years
  ↓
Short-term: Get promoted to Engineering Manager in 12 months
  ↓
Milestones: Lead 2 major projects, mentor 3 engineers
  ↓
Daily: Code review, 1-on-1s, technical documentation
```

### Balancing Multiple Goals

**Maximum Simultaneous Goals**:
- **Optimal**: 3-5 goals across life areas
- **Maximum**: 7 goals (overwhelming beyond this)
- **Minimum**: 1-2 goals (maintains focus)

**Goal Distribution**:
```
Recommended Mix:
- 1-2 Career/Professional goals
- 1-2 Health/Fitness goals
- 1 Financial goal
- 0-1 Personal development goal
- 0-1 Relationship goal

Avoid: 5 career goals, 0 health goals (imbalanced)
```

**Prioritization Matrix**:
```
High Impact + High Urgency: Do first
High Impact + Low Urgency: Schedule dedicated time
Low Impact + High Urgency: Delegate or minimize time
Low Impact + Low Urgency: Consider dropping
```
