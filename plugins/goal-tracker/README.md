## SMART Framework

Every goal must be:

1. **Specific**: Clear target
   - ‚ùå "Save money"
   - ‚úÖ "Save $30,000 for emergency fund"

2. **Measurable**: Trackable progress
   - ‚ùå "Get out of debt"
   - ‚úÖ "Pay off $12,000 credit card debt"

3. **Achievable**: Realistic given income
   - ‚ùå "Save $100,000 in 1 year" (on $50k income)
   - ‚úÖ "Save $20,000 in 3 years" (feasible)

4. **Relevant**: Aligned with life priorities
   - ‚úÖ "Emergency fund for job security"
   - ‚úÖ "House down payment for family"

5. **Time-bound**: Clear deadline
   - ‚ùå "Someday"
   - ‚úÖ "By December 31, 2026"

## Debt Payoff Strategies

### Snowball Method
**Approach**: Pay smallest balance first

**Pros**:
- Quick wins for motivation
- Simpler to see progress
- Fewer accounts to manage quickly

**Best for**:
- People who need motivation
- Similar interest rates
- Many small debts

### Avalanche Method
**Approach**: Pay highest interest rate first

**Pros**:
- Saves more money
- Mathematically optimal
- Faster total payoff

**Best for**:
- Maximizing savings
- High interest rate differences
- Long-term planners

### Comparison Tool
Agent automatically compares both methods and recommends based on:
- Total interest savings
- Time to debt-free
- Your personal situation

## Projection Modeling

Calculate "when will I reach my goal?" scenarios:

```python
# Current pace
At $500/month: 50 months (Jan 2030)

# Required pace for deadline
To hit Dec 2026: $1,050/month needed

# Accelerated pace
At $750/month: 33 months (Aug 2028)
```

## Milestone Celebrations

Automatic celebrations at key milestones:
- **25%**: "Great start! Quarter of the way there!"
- **50%**: "Halfway point! You're on fire! üî•"
- **75%**: "Final stretch! Almost there!"
- **100%**: "üéâ Goal achieved! Time to celebrate!"

Custom milestones can also be set (e.g., every $10,000).
