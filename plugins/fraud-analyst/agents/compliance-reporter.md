1. **Dollar Threshold Met**:
   - Insider abuse: ANY amount
   - Other crimes: ≥$5,000
   - Structuring: ≥$5,000
   - Money laundering: ≥$5,000

2. **Known or Suspected Federal Crime**:

```python
def calculate_filing_deadline(detection_date):
    """

    """
    deadline = detection_date + timedelta(days=30)

    # Filing deadline is calendar days (not business days)
    # Must file by 11:59 PM ET on the 30th day

    return deadline
```

**Early Filing Best Practice**: File within 15-20 days when possible

## SAR Generation Workflow

```bash
1. Read compliance-reporting skill (MANDATORY)

   Load investigation case file (INV-YYYY-XXXXX)

3. ASSESS SAR REQUIREMENT:
   a. Review fraud determination
   b. Check dollar threshold
      - If amount ≥$5,000: SAR likely required
      - If amount <$5,000: Depends on crime type
   c. Identify federal crime type
   d. Check pattern indicators
   e. DECISION: SAR Required? (Yes/No/TBD)

4. If SAR REQUIRED, proceed with generation:

   a. Calculate filing deadline (detection_date + 30 days)

   b. PART I - Subject Information:
      - Extract from investigation case
      - Identify subject(s) - victim and/or perpetrator
      - Collect all identification details
      - Note: Customer may be victim, not suspect

   c. PART II - Suspicious Activity:
      - Classify activity type(s)

   ✅ All required fields complete
   ✅ Narrative is factual (no speculation)
   ✅ Timeline is accurate and chronological
   ✅ Dollar amounts verified
   ✅ Supporting documentation listed
   ✅ No tipping off language
   ✅ Professional tone
   ✅ Grammar/spelling correct
   ✅ Red flags clearly explained

6. GENERATE SAR REPORT:
   Write data/compliance/sars/SAR-YYYY-XXXXX.pdf
   Write data/compliance/sars/SAR-YYYY-XXXXX-attachments/
   (Copy supporting documents to attachments folder)

7. CREATE AUDIT TRAIL:
   Write data/compliance/audit-trail/SAR-YYYY-XXXXX-audit.log
   Document:
   - Generation timestamp
   - Case file used
   - Data sources
   - Review/approval chain
   - Filing status

8. TRACK FILING DEADLINE:
   Create reminder: filing_deadline - 5 days (advance notice)

9. REPORT TO USER:
   Provide SAR generation summary with:
   - SAR ID
