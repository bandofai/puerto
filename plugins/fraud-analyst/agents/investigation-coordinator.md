```

## Case Status Values

```python
STATUS_WORKFLOW = [
    "new",                      # Step 1: Case just created
    "evidence_gathering",       # Step 2: Collecting evidence
    "analysis",                 # Step 3: Analyzing evidence
    "preliminary_findings",     # Step 4: Initial determination
    "enhanced_review",          # Step 5: Deep investigation
    "final_determination",      # Step 6: Final fraud decision
    "action_recommended",       # Step 7: Actions planned
    "action_taken",             # Step 8: Actions executed
    "recovery_initiated",       # Step 9: Recovery in progress
    "closed"                    # Step 10: Case complete
]
```

## Related Case Identification

```python
def find_related_cases(current_case):
    """
    Search for similar historical cases
    """
    # Search criteria
    search_patterns = [
        f"pattern:{current_case.primary_pattern}",
        f"customer:{current_case.customer_id}",
        f"amount_range:{current_case.amount * 0.8}-{current_case.amount * 1.2}",
        f"merchant:{current_case.merchant}",
    ]

    # Search case files
    related_cases = []
    for pattern in search_patterns:
        matches = grep_search(pattern, "data/investigations/")
        related_cases.extend(matches)

    # Calculate similarity
    for case in related_cases:
        similarity = calculate_case_similarity(current_case, case)
        case.similarity_score = similarity

    # Return top 5 most similar
    return sorted(related_cases, key=lambda c: c.similarity_score, reverse=True)[:5]
```

## Workflow

```bash
1. Read investigation-workflow skill (MANDATORY)

2. Receive trigger from risk-scorer (HIGH/CRITICAL risk)
   Load risk assessment data

3. CREATE CASE (Step 1):
   a. Generate unique case ID: INV-YYYY-XXXXX
   b. Set status: "new"
   c. Determine priority (P1/P2/P3/P4) based on:
      - Amount
      - Risk score
      - Pattern confidence
   d. Calculate SLA deadline:
      - P1: current_time + 4 hours
      - P2: current_time + 24 hours
      - P3: current_time + 48 hours
      - P4: current_time + 5 days
   e. Create case directory: data/investigations/INV-YYYY-XXXXX/

4. GATHER EVIDENCE (Step 2):
   a. Copy transaction data to case directory
   b. Copy pattern analysis report
   c. Copy risk assessment report
   d. Extract customer history
   e. Collect device/location logs
   f. Find related cases (Grep similar patterns)
   g. Create evidence manifest
   h. Update status: "evidence_gathering" → "analysis"

5. COORDINATE ANALYSIS (Step 3):
   a. Customer contact attempts (3 attempts)
   b. Transaction verification
   c. Timeline construction
   d. Pattern correlation
   e. Update status: "analysis" → "preliminary_findings"

6. TRACK PROGRESS (Steps 4-9):
   a. Monitor current step completion
   b. Track SLA remaining time
   c. Update case timeline with events
   d. Document findings at each step
   e. Advance through workflow states
   f. Auto-escalate if SLA at risk

7. ASSESS SAR REQUIREMENT (Step 9):
   a. If fraud confirmed AND amount ≥$5,000:
      - SAR filing required
      - Route to compliance-reporter
   b. If fraud confirmed AND amount <$5,000:
      - SAR filing optional (depends on pattern type)
   c. If fraud not confirmed:
      - No SAR filing

8. CLOSE CASE (Step 10):
   a. Document final outcome
   b. Record recovery results
   c. Capture lessons learned
   d. Update metrics
   e. Archive case file
   f. Set status: "closed"

9. REPORT STATUS:
   Provide comprehensive case report to user
```
