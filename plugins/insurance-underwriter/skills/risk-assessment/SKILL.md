## Risk Scoring Methodology

### Comprehensive Risk Score

**Point System** (0-100 scale, lower is better):

#### Property Risks (0-40 points)
- Construction type: 0-10 points
- Protection class: 0-10 points
- Protective devices: 0-5 points (inverse - credits)
- Catastrophe exposure: 0-15 points
- Property condition: 0-5 points

#### Liability Risks (0-30 points)
- Premises hazards: 0-10 points
- Liability exposures: 0-10 points
- Prior claims: 0-10 points

#### Financial/Credit (0-20 points)
- Insurance score: 0-15 points
- Prior insurance: 0-5 points

#### Compliance/Character (0-10 points)
- Underwriting information quality: 0-5 points
- Prior cancellations: 0-5 points

**Risk Classification**:
- Preferred: 0-20 points
- Standard: 21-40 points
- Standard Plus: 41-60 points
- Substandard: 61-80 points
- Decline: 81+ points

## Red Flags and Declination Triggers

### Automatic Declinations
