## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Budget Variance Analysis

**What it does**:
- Calculates variance (actual - budget) in $ and %
- Identifies significant variances using materiality thresholds (>10% or >$10K)
- Categorizes as favorable/unfavorable based on line item type
- Performs root cause analysis explaining why variances occurred
- Tracks variance trends over time (improving, worsening, stable)
- Provides evidence-based recommendations

**Industry-Standard Formulas** (from skill):
```excel
Variance ($) = Actual - Budget
Variance (%) = (Actual - Budget) / Budget × 100%
Significant = IF(OR(ABS(Variance $)>10000, ABS(Variance %)>0.1), "Yes", "No")
```

**Materiality Thresholds**:
- **Critical**: >20% or >$50K
- **High**: 10-20% or $10K-$50K
- **Medium**: 5-10% or $5K-$10K
- **Low**: <5% or <$5K

### 2. Spend Tracking by Department

**What it does**:
- Monitors departmental budget utilization rates
- Calculates burn rate (monthly average spending)
- Projects runway (months until budget exhausted)
- Compares actual vs expected utilization
- Creates department comparison dashboards
- Flags departments over budget

**Key Metrics**:
```excel
Budget Utilization % = (Actual Spend / Total Budget) × 100%
Burn Rate = YTD Actual / Months Elapsed
Runway = Budget Remaining / Burn Rate
Expected Utilization = (Months Elapsed / 12) × 100%
```

### 3. Forecasting Models

**Methods Supported**:

**Linear Trend** (for stable growth):
```excel
=FORECAST(future_month, actual_range, month_range)
```

**Moving Average** (for volatile data):
```excel
=AVERAGE(Last_N_Months)
```

**Seasonal Adjustment** (for recurring patterns):
```excel
Forecast = Trend × Seasonal_Index
```

**Scenario Analysis**:
- Conservative (20% probability): Worst case assumptions
- Moderate (60% probability): Most likely, planning scenario
- Aggressive (20% probability): Best case assumptions

**Forecast Accuracy Tracking**:
```excel
MAPE = AVERAGE(ABS((Actual - Forecast) / Actual))
Accuracy = 100% - MAPE
Target: >90% accuracy
```

### 4. Budget Optimization

**Strategies**:

**Quick Wins (0-30 days)**:
- Eliminate duplicate subscriptions
- Renegotiate vendor contracts
- Consolidate purchases for volume discounts
- Switch to annual billing (15-20% savings)

**Medium-Term (30-90 days)**:
- Process automation
- Vendor consolidation
- Outsourcing analysis

**Long-Term (90+ days)**:
- Zero-based budget review
- Technology platform consolidation
- Organizational restructuring

**ROI-Based Prioritization**:
```excel
ROI = (Expected Benefit - Cost) / Cost
Rank projects by ROI, fund highest first
```

### 5. Quarterly Reporting

**Report Types**:

**Executive Dashboard** (1-page summary):
- Financial overview (budget vs actual)
- Department performance
- Key highlights and action items
- Year-end forecast

**Detailed Variance Report** (6-10 pages):
- Executive summary
- Revenue analysis
- Expense analysis
- Department deep dives
- Forecast & outlook
- Appendix

**KPIs Tracked**:
- Operating Margin
- Budget Utilization %
- Forecast Accuracy
- Cost per Employee
- Revenue per Employee
- Burn Rate & Runway

## Best Practices

### DO

✅ **Read skills before starting** - Budget-analysis skill contains battle-tested formulas
✅ **Validate data quality** - Check completeness, accuracy, consistency before analysis
✅ **Use materiality thresholds** - Focus on significant variances (>10% or >$10K)
✅ **Explain root causes** - Don't just calculate variances, explain why
✅ **Provide actionable recommendations** - Specific, measurable, achievable actions
✅ **Document assumptions** - Especially in forecasts
✅ **Use multiple forecasting methods** - Compare results for validation
✅ **Present visually** - Charts and dashboards over tables
✅ **Tailor to audience** - Executive summary for C-level, details for finance team
✅ **Track forecast accuracy** - Learn from errors and improve models

### DON'T

❌ **Skip data validation** - Garbage in, garbage out
❌ **Report every small variance** - Focus on material items
❌ **Calculate without explanation** - Root cause analysis is critical
❌ **Provide vague recommendations** - Be specific with actions and owners
❌ **Forecast without assumptions** - Document what you're assuming
❌ **Rely on single method** - Use multiple approaches
❌ **Use tables when charts are clearer** - Visualizations improve understanding
❌ **Use technical jargon with executives** - Keep it simple
❌ **Ignore forecast errors** - Track accuracy and improve

---

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Variance Thresholds

Adjust materiality thresholds based on budget size:

```
For budgets < $100K:  10% or $5K
For budgets $100K-$1M: 10% or $10K
For budgets $1M-$10M: 8% or $50K
For budgets > $10M: 5% or $100K
```

### Multi-Currency Handling

For international budgets:
1. Convert all amounts to single currency
2. Document exchange rates used
3. Note exchange rate as assumption in forecasts
4. Track FX gains/losses separately

### Zero-Based Budgeting

For comprehensive budget review:
```
@budget-analyst Perform zero-based budget review for Marketing department
```

Agent will:
- Categorize expenses (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have)
- Justify each category from zero
- Rank by ROI
- Recommend funding priority

- Verify agent is installed: `ls ~/.claude/plugins/budget-analyst/agents/`

### Variance calculations seem incorrect

**Symptom**: Numbers don't match expectations

**Solutions**:
- Check data quality (completeness, accuracy)
- Verify budget and actuals use same categories
- Check for timing mismatches (monthly vs daily)
- Review reconciliation between systems
- Validate formulas against skill definitions

### Forecast is inaccurate

**Symptom**: Forecast significantly different from actual

**Solutions**:
- Check assumptions documented in forecast
- Verify historical data used is accurate
- Consider using different forecasting method
- Add scenario analysis for uncertainty
- Track forecast accuracy over time and improve

### Missing data errors

**Symptom**: Agent reports missing data

**Solutions**:
- Check that budget file exists and is accessible
- Verify actuals data is complete for the period
- Ensure file formats are compatible (Excel, CSV)
- Validate date ranges align between budget and actuals

### Integration with accounting system fails

**Symptom**: Cannot load data from accounting system

**Solutions**:
- Export data as CSV (universal format)
- Check CSV has required columns (Date, Department, Category, Amount)
- Verify no special characters or formatting issues
- Map accounting categories to budget categories
