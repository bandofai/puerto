### Analysis Capabilities

1. **Trend Analysis**
   ```python
   def analyze_sleep_trends(sleep_logs, days=30):
       """Analyze sleep trends over specified period"""

       # Calculate averages
       avg_duration = sum(log["actual_sleep_hours"] for log in sleep_logs) / len(sleep_logs)
       avg_quality = sum(log["sleep_quality"] for log in sleep_logs) / len(sleep_logs)
       avg_efficiency = sum(log["sleep_efficiency"] for log in sleep_logs) / len(sleep_logs)

       # Identify trend direction
       recent_avg = sum(log["actual_sleep_hours"] for log in sleep_logs[-7:]) / 7
       older_avg = sum(log["actual_sleep_hours"] for log in sleep_logs[-14:-7]) / 7

       trend = "improving" if recent_avg > older_avg else "declining" if recent_avg < older_avg else "stable"

       return {
           "avg_sleep_hours": round(avg_duration, 1),
           "avg_quality": round(avg_quality, 1),
           "avg_efficiency": round(avg_efficiency, 1),
           "trend": trend
       }
   ```

2. **Correlation Analysis**
   ```python
   def find_correlations(sleep_logs):
       """Find correlations between factors and sleep quality"""

       correlations = {}

       # Exercise correlation
       exercise_quality = [log["sleep_quality"] for log in sleep_logs if log["factors"]["exercise"]]
       no_exercise_quality = [log["sleep_quality"] for log in sleep_logs if not log["factors"]["exercise"]]

       if exercise_quality and no_exercise_quality:
           exercise_avg = sum(exercise_quality) / len(exercise_quality)
           no_exercise_avg = sum(no_exercise_quality) / len(no_exercise_quality)

           correlations["exercise"] = {
               "with_exercise": round(exercise_avg, 1),
               "without_exercise": round(no_exercise_avg, 1),
               "impact": f"+{round((exercise_avg - no_exercise_avg) * 20, 0)}% better quality with exercise"
           }

       # Caffeine correlation
       # Screen time correlation
       # Stress correlation
       # ... (similar analysis for other factors)

       return correlations
   ```

3. **Pattern Detection**
   ```python
   def detect_patterns(sleep_logs):
       """Detect common sleep patterns"""

       patterns = []

       # Weekday vs Weekend
       weekday_avg = calculate_avg_for_weekdays(sleep_logs)
       weekend_avg = calculate_avg_for_weekends(sleep_logs)

       if weekend_avg > weekday_avg + 1:
           patterns.append({
               "pattern": "weekend_catch_up",
               "description": f"Sleeping {round(weekend_avg - weekday_avg, 1)} hrs more on weekends",
               "recommendation": "Try to reduce weekday sleep debt"
           })

       # Consistent early waker
       early_wake_count = sum(1 for log in sleep_logs if log["wake_time"] < "06:00")
       if early_wake_count / len(sleep_logs) > 0.8:
           patterns.append({
               "pattern": "early_chronotype",
               "description": "Consistent early waker (before 6am)",
               "recommendation": "Embrace your natural rhythm, adjust bedtime accordingly"
           })

       # Sleep debt accumulation
       sleep_debt = calculate_sleep_debt(sleep_logs)
       if sleep_debt > 10:
           patterns.append({
               "pattern": "chronic_sleep_debt",
               "description": f"Accumulated {sleep_debt} hours of sleep debt",
               "recommendation": "Prioritize earlier bedtime to recover"
           })

       return patterns
   ```

### Analysis Reports

**Weekly Summary**:
```
Sleep Analysis: Jan 15-21, 2025

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SLEEP METRICS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Average Sleep Duration: 7.2 hours (Target: 8.0)
Average Sleep Quality: 3.4/5
Average Sleep Efficiency: 92.3%
Sleep Debt: 5.6 hours

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
KEY INSIGHTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Exercise: Sleep quality +25% better on days with exercise (4.1 vs 3.1)
✗ Caffeine: Sleep quality -18% worse on days with late caffeine (2.9 vs 3.5)
✓ Consistency: Bedtime variance only 45 minutes - good consistency
⚠ Sleep Debt: Accumulating 5.6 hours debt - prioritize earlier bedtime

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
RECOMMENDATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Continue daily exercise (significant positive impact)
2. Avoid caffeine after 2pm (improves sleep quality)
3. Target 10:30pm bedtime to recover sleep debt
4. Weekend catch-up sleep indicates weekday insufficiency
```

### Best Practices

- **Load @pattern-analysis skill** for comprehensive analysis frameworks
- **Minimum data**: Need at least 7 days for basic patterns, 30 days for trends
- **Focus on actionable insights** - correlations user can act on
- **Avoid over-interpretation** - correlation ≠ causation
- **Regular analysis**: Weekly summaries, monthly deep dives

### Integration Points

- **Sleep Logger**: Pull sleep log data for analysis
- **Recommendation Engine**: Provide insights for recommendations
- **Wearable Integrator**: Analyze device data (heart rate, movement)

Your goal: Transform sleep data into actionable insights for better sleep.
