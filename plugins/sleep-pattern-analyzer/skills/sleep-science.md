# Sleep Science Skill

Comprehensive patterns for understanding sleep stages, tracking sleep metrics, improving sleep quality, and managing sleep disorders.

## Sleep Fundamentals

### Sleep Architecture

Sleep consists of distinct stages that cycle throughout the night, each serving essential functions for physical and mental health.

**Sleep Cycle Duration**
- Complete cycle: 90-110 minutes
- Typical night: 4-6 cycles
- Cycles change composition through night:
  - Early night: More deep sleep
  - Late night: More REM sleep

### Sleep Stages

#### Non-REM Sleep (75-80% of sleep)

**Stage 1: Light Sleep (N1)**
- Duration: 1-5 minutes per cycle
- Percentage: 2-5% of total sleep
- Characteristics:
  - Transition from wakefulness
  - Easy to wake up
  - Muscle activity slows
  - Eyes move slowly
  - May experience hypnic jerks (muscle twitches)
  - Brain waves slow from beta to alpha to theta
- Function:
  - Transition phase
  - Minimal restorative value

**Stage 2: Light Sleep (N2)**
- Duration: 10-25 minutes per cycle (increases through night)
- Percentage: 45-55% of total sleep
- Characteristics:
  - Heart rate slows
  - Body temperature drops
  - Eye movement stops
  - Brain produces sleep spindles (bursts of activity)
  - K-complexes appear (sudden brain wave patterns)
- Function:
  - Memory consolidation
  - Learning retention
  - Preparing for deep sleep

**Stage 3: Deep Sleep (N3 / Slow-Wave Sleep)**
- Duration: 20-40 minutes per cycle (more in first half of night)
- Percentage: 15-25% of total sleep
- Characteristics:
  - Delta waves (slow brain waves) dominate
  - Very difficult to wake
  - No eye movement
  - Muscle activity minimal
  - Blood pressure drops
  - Breathing slows
  - Body temperature lowest
- Function:
  - Physical restoration and growth
  - Tissue repair
  - Immune system strengthening
  - Hormone regulation (growth hormone release)
  - Energy restoration
  - Waste removal from brain (glymphatic system)
- Most important for feeling rested
- Decreases with age

#### REM Sleep (20-25% of sleep)

**Rapid Eye Movement (REM)**
- Duration: 10 minutes (first cycle) to 60 minutes (last cycle)
- Percentage: 20-25% of total sleep
- Characteristics:
  - Rapid eye movements
  - Brain very active (similar to waking)
  - Dreams most vivid and memorable
  - Body temporarily paralyzed (atonia) - prevents acting out dreams
  - Heart rate and breathing irregular
  - Blood pressure rises
  - Brain temperature increases
- Function:
  - Memory consolidation (especially procedural)
  - Learning and problem-solving
  - Emotional processing
  - Creativity and insight
  - Brain development (critical in infants)
- First REM occurs 90 minutes after falling asleep
- REM periods lengthen through night

### Sleep Cycle Progression

**Typical 8-Hour Night**

**Cycle 1 (0-90 min)**
- N1: 5 min
- N2: 25 min
- N3: 45 min (lots of deep sleep)
- REM: 15 min

**Cycle 2 (90-180 min)**
- N2: 30 min
- N3: 35 min
- REM: 25 min

**Cycle 3 (180-270 min)**
- N2: 35 min
- N3: 25 min (deep sleep decreasing)
- REM: 30 min

**Cycle 4 (270-360 min)**
- N2: 40 min
- N3: 15 min
- REM: 35 min (REM increasing)

**Cycle 5 (360-450 min)**
- N2: 40 min
- N3: 5 min (minimal deep sleep)
- REM: 45 min

**Cycle 6 (450-540 min)**
- N2: 30 min
- N3: 0 min (no deep sleep)
- REM: 60 min (peak REM)

### Sleep Drive and Regulation

**Two-Process Model of Sleep**

**Process S: Sleep Homeostasis (Sleep Pressure)**
- Builds throughout waking hours
- Adenosine accumulates in brain
- Longer awake = stronger sleep pressure
- Released during sleep (especially deep sleep)
- Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors

**Process C: Circadian Rhythm**
- 24-hour internal clock
- Controlled by suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in brain
- Influenced by:
  - Light exposure (primary)
  - Temperature
  - Meal timing
  - Social cues
- Promotes alertness during day, sleep at night
- Peak alertness: 10am and 6pm
- Peak sleepiness: 2-4am and 1-3pm (afternoon dip)

**Optimal Sleep Occurs When:**
- High sleep pressure (been awake 14-16 hours)
- Circadian rhythm promotes sleep (nighttime)
- Both processes aligned

### Melatonin and Sleep

**Melatonin Production**
- Hormone produced by pineal gland
- "Darkness hormone" - signals nighttime
- Production starts 2-3 hours before sleep time
- Peak levels: 2-4am
- Suppressed by light (especially blue light)
- Not a sleep inducer - signals "biological night"

**Factors Affecting Melatonin**
- **Suppresses**: Bright light, screens, blue light
- **Enhances**: Darkness, dim red/amber light
- **Timing**: Light exposure timing shifts rhythm
  - Morning light: Earlier rhythm (wake earlier)
  - Evening light: Later rhythm (wake later)

## Sleep Hygiene Principles

### Consistent Sleep Schedule

**Why It Matters**
- Strengthens circadian rhythm
- Improves sleep quality
- Makes falling asleep easier
- Enhances daytime alertness

**Best Practices**
- Same bedtime every night (within 30 minutes)
- Same wake time every morning (even weekends)
- Avoid sleeping in on weekends (max 1 hour difference)
- No naps after 3pm
- Limit naps to 20-30 minutes
- Wake at consistent time even if poor sleep (resets rhythm)

**Sleep Schedule Template**
```
Target Sleep: 7-9 hours
Bedtime: 10:30 PM (every night)
Wake Time: 6:30 AM (every day)

Wind-down starts: 9:30 PM (1 hour before bed)
Screens off: 10:00 PM (30 min before bed)
Lights dim: 10:00 PM
In bed: 10:30 PM
```

### Sleep Environment Optimization

**Temperature**
- Optimal: 60-67°F (15-19°C)
- Cool room promotes sleep onset
- Body temperature drops during sleep
- Too hot interferes with deep sleep and REM
- Too cold causes restlessness
- Solutions:
  - Lower thermostat at night
  - Use fan for air circulation
  - Breathable bedding (cotton, bamboo)
  - Cooling mattress pad
  - Keep hands and feet warm (socks if needed)

**Darkness**
- Complete darkness ideal
- Even small light disrupts sleep
- Light signals "daytime" to brain
- Solutions:
  - Blackout curtains or shades
  - Eye mask
  - Cover or remove LED lights
  - Use red nightlight if needed (doesn't suppress melatonin)
  - Put phone face-down
  - Avoid checking time at night (creates stress)

**Noise**
- Quiet environment optimal
- Sudden noises disrupt sleep (more than constant)
- Solutions:
  - White noise machine (masks disruptive sounds)
  - Earplugs (foam or silicone)
  - Fan for white noise
  - Sound machine (rain, ocean, etc.)
  - Close windows if street noise
  - Ask household for quiet hours

**Bed and Mattress**
- Mattress life: 7-10 years
- Firmness: Personal preference, but supportive
  - Side sleepers: Medium to medium-soft
  - Back sleepers: Medium to medium-firm
  - Stomach sleepers: Firmer
- Pillows: Replace every 1-2 years
  - Support neck alignment
  - Height appropriate for sleep position
- Bedding: Clean, comfortable, breathable

**Bedroom as Sleep Sanctuary**
- Use bedroom only for sleep and intimacy
- No TV, work, or stressful activities
- Keep clutter minimal
- Calming colors and decor
- Remove work materials
- No bright overhead lights (use lamps with dim bulbs)

### Light Exposure Management

**Morning Light Exposure (Critical)**
- Get bright light within 30-60 minutes of waking
- 10-30 minutes outdoors (even cloudy day)
- Advances circadian rhythm (helps wake earlier)
- Improves nighttime melatonin production
- Boosts mood and alertness
- Methods:
  - Go outside immediately upon waking
  - Walk, exercise, or drink coffee outside
  - Sit near bright window
  - Light therapy box (10,000 lux) if no sun

**Daytime Light**
- Bright light during day strengthens rhythm
- Work near windows if possible
- Take breaks outside
- Light therapy if in dark environment all day

**Evening Light Management**
- Dim lights 2-3 hours before bed
- Avoid bright overhead lights
- Use lamps with warm bulbs (2700K or less)
- Amber/red lights don't suppress melatonin
- Candlelight okay

**Screen Time and Blue Light**
- Screens emit blue light (suppresses melatonin)
- Stop screens 1-2 hours before bed (ideal)
- Minimum 30 minutes before bed
- If must use screens:
  - Enable night mode/night shift (reduces blue light)
  - Lower brightness significantly
  - Use blue light blocking glasses (amber lenses)
  - Increase distance from screen
  - Use apps: f.lux, Night Shift (iOS), Night Light (Android)
- TV: Less problematic if across room, but still stimulating

### Exercise and Physical Activity

**Benefits for Sleep**
- Increases deep sleep
- Reduces sleep latency (time to fall asleep)
- Improves sleep efficiency
- Reduces daytime sleepiness
- Helps with insomnia
- Reduces sleep apnea severity

**Timing Recommendations**
- **Best**: Morning or afternoon exercise
- **Okay**: Early evening (finish 3-4 hours before bed)
- **Avoid**: Vigorous exercise within 2 hours of bedtime
  - Increases core temperature
  - Stimulates nervous system
  - Delays sleep onset
- **Exception**: Light stretching, yoga, or walking okay before bed

**Exercise Guidelines**
- 150 minutes moderate activity per week
- Or 75 minutes vigorous activity
- Consistency matters more than intensity
- Outdoor exercise even better (light exposure)
- Regular exercisers fall asleep faster

### Diet and Nutrition

**Foods That Promote Sleep**
- **Tryptophan**: Precursor to serotonin and melatonin
  - Turkey, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy, nuts, seeds
- **Magnesium**: Relaxation mineral
  - Leafy greens, nuts, seeds, whole grains
- **Complex carbs**: Promote tryptophan uptake
  - Oats, whole grain bread, brown rice
- **Melatonin-rich**: Natural melatonin
  - Tart cherry juice, pistachios, tomatoes
- **Calcium**: Helps brain produce melatonin
  - Dairy, leafy greens, fortified foods

**Evening Eating Guidelines**
- Finish dinner 2-3 hours before bed
- Large meals too close to bed disrupt sleep
- Light snack okay if hungry (avoid going to bed hungry)
- Good bedtime snacks:
  - Banana with almond butter
  - Oatmeal with milk
  - Whole grain toast with turkey
  - Greek yogurt with berries
  - Handful of pistachios or almonds
  - Tart cherry juice

**Foods and Drinks to Avoid**

**Caffeine**
- Half-life: 5-6 hours (25% still in system after 12 hours)
- Blocks adenosine (sleep pressure signal)
- Cut off time: 2pm (or 6-8 hours before bed)
- Sources: Coffee, tea, soda, energy drinks, chocolate
- Sensitivity varies (some need cutoff earlier)

**Alcohol**
- Initially sedating but disrupts sleep
- Suppresses REM sleep
- Causes nighttime awakenings (rebound effect)
- Increases sleep apnea and snoring
- Avoid 3-4 hours before bed
- If drinking, earlier in evening and hydrate

**Heavy, Spicy, or Acidic Foods**
- Can cause heartburn or indigestion
- Discomfort interferes with sleep
- Avoid within 3 hours of bed

**Large Fluid Intake**
- Causes nighttime awakenings to urinate (nocturia)
- Stop drinking fluids 1-2 hours before bed
- Empty bladder before bed

**Sugar and Refined Carbs**
- Blood sugar spikes and crashes
- Can cause nighttime awakenings
- Choose complex carbs instead

### Pre-Sleep Routine (Wind-Down)

**60-90 Minute Wind-Down**
- Signals brain that sleep is approaching
- Allows transition from active to relaxed state
- Consistent routine strengthens sleep association

**Effective Wind-Down Activities**
- Reading (physical book, not screen)
- Listening to calming music or podcast
- Gentle stretching or yoga
- Meditation or breathing exercises
- Taking a warm bath or shower
- Journaling or gratitude practice
- Light household tasks (non-stimulating)
- Preparing for next day (reduces bedtime worry)

**Bath or Shower Timing**
- Warm bath 90 minutes before bed (ideal)
- Raises body temperature, then drops (signals sleep)
- Temperature drop mimics natural sleep onset
- 10-20 minute bath sufficient
- Epsom salt bath (magnesium absorption)

**Avoid Before Bed**
- Work or problem-solving
- Difficult conversations
- Checking email or social media
- Exciting TV shows or movies
- Video games
- Exercise (vigorous)
- Bright lights
- Stressful activities

### Stress and Anxiety Management

**Cognitive Techniques**

- **Thought Stopping**: When ruminating, firmly say "STOP"
- **Cognitive Reframing**: Challenge anxious thoughts
- **Acceptance**: Accept you can't control everything

**Relaxation Techniques**

**Progressive Muscle Relaxation**
1. Tense muscle group 5 seconds
2. Release and notice relaxation
3. Progress through body (feet → head)
4. 10-15 minutes total

**4-7-8 Breathing**
1. Exhale completely
2. Inhale through nose for 4 counts
3. Hold breath for 7 counts
4. Exhale through mouth for 8 counts
5. Repeat 4 times

**Body Scan Meditation**
1. Focus attention on body parts sequentially
2. Notice sensations without judgment
3. Releases physical tension
4. Redirects mind from thoughts

**Visualization**
- Imagine peaceful, calming scene
- Engage all senses (sight, sound, smell, touch)
- Example: Beach (waves, warmth, sand, breeze)

**Journaling**
- Write worries or to-do list before bed
- Transfers from mind to paper
- Reduces rumination
- Gratitude journaling promotes positive mindset

### Bedroom Behavior Guidelines

**Stimulus Control**
- Associate bed with sleep only
- If can't sleep after 20 minutes, get up
- Go to different room, do relaxing activity
- Return to bed when sleepy
- Repeat if necessary
- Strengthens bed-sleep association

**Don't Watch the Clock**
- Creates performance anxiety
- Turn clock away from view
- Trust that you'll wake with alarm
- Checking time increases stress

**Don't Force Sleep**
- Sleep is automatic process
- Trying too hard backfires
- Adopt "whatever happens" attitude
- Trust that body knows how to sleep

## Sleep Metrics and Tracking

### Key Sleep Metrics

**Total Sleep Time (TST)**
- Total time spent asleep (all stages)
- Recommended amounts:
  - Adults (18-64): 7-9 hours
  - Older adults (65+): 7-8 hours
  - Teenagers: 8-10 hours
  - Children: 9-13 hours (varies by age)
- Individual variation: Some need less, some more
- Quality matters as much as quantity

**Sleep Efficiency**
- Percentage of time in bed actually sleeping
- Formula: (TST / Time in Bed) × 100
- Excellent: >85%
- Good: 80-85%
- Fair: 75-80%
- Poor: <75%
- Example: Sleep 7 hours of 8 hours in bed = 87.5% efficiency

**Sleep Latency**
- Time to fall asleep after lights out
- Healthy range: 10-20 minutes
- <5 minutes: May indicate sleep deprivation
- >30 minutes: May indicate insomnia or poor sleep hygiene
- Average: 10-15 minutes

**Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO)**
- Time awake after initially falling asleep
- Before final awakening
- Normal: Brief awakenings (don't remember most)
- Healthy: <20 minutes per night
- Concerning: >30-45 minutes regularly
- Increases with age

**Number of Awakenings**
- Times you wake during night
- Brief awakenings (<1-2 min): Normal, often don't remember
- Typical: 2-4 brief awakenings
- Problematic: Frequent or long awakenings
- Causes: Noise, light, temperature, sleep disorders, stress

**Sleep Stage Distribution**

**Healthy Adult Percentages**
- Light sleep (N1+N2): 50-60%
  - N1: 2-5%
  - N2: 45-55%
- Deep sleep (N3): 15-25%
- REM: 20-25%

**Age-Related Changes**

- Brain briefly arouses to restart breathing

**Types**

**Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)** - Most Common
- Airway physically blocked
- Throat muscles relax, tongue falls back
- Soft palate collapses
- Breathing effort continues but airflow stops

**Central Sleep Apnea (CSA)** - Less Common
- Brain doesn't signal breathing muscles
- No breathing effort
- Associated with heart failure, stroke, opioid use

**Risk Factors**
- Overweight/obesity (most significant)

- 30-60 minutes daily

**Melatonin**
- Low dose (0.5-3mg)
- Timing critical:
  - Advance rhythm: Take evening (8-10pm)
  - Delay rhythm: Take upon waking
- Signals "biological night"
- More effective with light therapy

**Chronotherapy**
- Gradually shift sleep schedule
- Advance or delay 15-30 min every few days
- Requires strict adherence
- Time-intensive

**Sleep Hygiene and Scheduling**
- Consistent wake time (most important)
- Light/dark exposure aligned with desired schedule
- Avoid naps
- Strategic caffeine use

### Narcolepsy

**Definition**
- Neurological disorder affecting sleep-wake control
- Excessive daytime sleepiness (hallmark)
- Sudden sleep attacks
- Caused by deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) - brain chemical regulating wakefulness

**Types**

**Type 1 (with Cataplexy)**
- Includes cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness)
- Low/absent hypocretin
- More severe

**Type 2 (without Cataplexy)**
- No cataplexy
- Normal hypocretin (usually)
- Excessive sleepiness only

**Symptoms**

**Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS)** - Required for Diagnosis
- Overwhelming sleepiness despite adequate sleep
- Involuntary sleep attacks
- Difficulty staying awake
- Unrefreshing naps (usually)

**Cataplexy** - Type 1 Only
- Sudden bilateral muscle weakness
- Triggered by strong emotion (laughter, surprise, anger)
- Range from mild (face drooping) to severe (collapse)
- Remain conscious throughout
- Lasts seconds to minutes
- Can occur many times daily

**Sleep Paralysis**
- Temporary inability to move upon waking or falling asleep
- Conscious but can't move or speak
- Lasts seconds to minutes
- Can be frightening
- Common in general population but more frequent in narcolepsy

**Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations**
- Vivid, dream-like experiences
- Occur while falling asleep (hypnagogic) or waking (hypnopompic)
- Visual, auditory, or sensory
- Can be frightening
- Often occur with sleep paralysis

**Fragmented Nighttime Sleep**
- Frequent awakenings
- Poor quality sleep despite feeling sleepy

**Diagnosis**
- Clinical history
- Sleep diary
- Epworth Sleepiness Scale
- Polysomnography (overnight sleep study)
- Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)
  - Series of nap opportunities during day
  - Measure time to fall asleep
  - REM sleep within 15 min of sleep onset (2+ naps) suggests narcolepsy
- Hypocretin level (spinal tap) - if needed

**Treatment**

**Medications**
- **Stimulants**: Modafinil, armodafinil (first-line)
- **Amphetamines**: For refractory sleepiness
- **Sodium oxybate**: For cataplexy and EDS
- **Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors**: For cataplexy
- **Antidepressants** (SSRIs, SNRIs): For cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hallucinations

**Lifestyle Management**
- Scheduled naps (2-3 per day, 15-20 min)
- Consistent sleep schedule
- Good sleep hygiene
- Avoid alcohol and sedatives
- Safety precautions (driving)
- Educate family, friends, employers
- Medical alert bracelet

**Not Curable but Manageable**

### Parasomnias

**Sleepwalking (Somnambulism)**
- Walking or performing activities while asleep
- Occurs during deep sleep (N3)
- Usually first half of night
- Partial arousal (not fully awake or asleep)
- No memory of episode
- More common in children
- Can be dangerous (injuries)

**Sleep Talking (Somniloquy)**
- Speaking during sleep
- Can occur in any stage
- Usually harmless
- Common (many people do this occasionally)
- Speech ranges from mumbling to full conversations

**Night Terrors (Sleep Terrors)**
- Sudden arousal from deep sleep with fear
- Screaming, thrashing, rapid heart rate
- Occurs first third of night (deep sleep)
- Person not fully awake
- No memory of event
- More common in children (usually outgrow)

**REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD)**
- Acting out dreams during REM
- Normal paralysis during REM absent
- Can be violent (punching, kicking, jumping)
- Occurs later in night (when REM peaks)
- Can injure self or bed partner
- More common in older adults and men
- Associated with Parkinson's and dementia
- Treatment: Melatonin, clonazepam, bedroom safety

**Nightmares**
- Disturbing dreams with awakening
- Occur during REM sleep
- Full recall of dream
- Common (occasional nightmares normal)
- Frequent nightmares may indicate stress, trauma, medications

## Chronotypes and Individual Differences

### Chronotype Categories

**Larks (Morning People)**
- Natural early risers
- Peak performance morning and early afternoon
- Preferred sleep: 9pm-5am or 10pm-6am
- Alert immediately upon waking
- Decline in evening
- More common in older adults

**Owls (Evening People)**
- Natural late sleepers
- Peak performance late afternoon and evening
- Preferred sleep: 12am-8am or later
- Slow to wake, groggy in morning
- "Second wind" in evening
- More common in adolescents and young adults

**Intermediate/Hummingbirds** (Most People)
- Flexible sleep-wake timing
- Peak performance midday
- Can adapt to various schedules (somewhat)
- Preferred sleep: 11pm-7am

### Genetic Basis

**Clock Genes**
- Determine chronotype
- Affect circadian rhythm length
- PER3 gene variation:
  - Long version: Morning preference
  - Short version: Evening preference

**Heritability**
- Chronotype 50% heritable
- Can't change genetic chronotype
- But can work with it or adapt (to degree)

### Chronotype Considerations

**School and Work**
- Society favors morning chronotype
- Evening types at disadvantage (school, work start early)
- "Social jet lag" - mismatch between biological and social time
- Performance suffers when forced against chronotype

**Strategies for Evening Types**
- Bright light in morning (shift rhythm earlier)
- Avoid bright light at night
- Consistent wake time (even weekends)
- Strategic caffeine use (morning only)
- Request later work hours if possible

**Strategies for Morning Types**
- Maintain early schedule (natural preference)
- Dim lights earlier in evening if want to stay up
- Evening bright light to delay rhythm slightly
- Avoid early evening naps

**Age-Related Changes**
- Children: Early bedtime (7-8pm)
- Adolescents: Shift later (delayed sleep phase - biological)
- Adults: Gradual shift earlier with age
- Older adults: Often very early (advanced sleep phase)

### Sleep Need Variations

**Short Sleepers** (Rare)
- Function well on <6 hours
- True short sleepers (genetic) very rare (<1% population)
- DEC2 gene mutation in some
- NOT sleep-deprived (don't need more)
- Don't confuse with sleep-deprived person who tolerates it

**Long Sleepers**
- Need >9 hours to function optimally
- 2% of population
- Genetic basis
- Not laziness - biological need

**Average Sleepers**
- 7-9 hours
- Most of population

**Determining Your Need**
- How much do you sleep on vacation (no alarm)?
- After 2-3 weeks, settle into natural pattern
- This is likely your true need

## Special Populations

### Adolescents and Teenagers

**Biological Changes**
- Puberty shifts circadian rhythm later (delayed)
- Melatonin released later (up to 2 hours)
- Natural bedtime: 11pm-12am
- Natural wake time: 8am-9am
- Need 8-10 hours sleep

**School Start Times**
- Early start conflicts with biology
- 8am start = 6am for teen biology
- Chronic sleep deprivation common
- Affects:
  - Academic performance
  - Mood and mental health
  - Risk-taking behavior
  - Driving safety (drowsy driving)

**Recommendations**
- Later school start times (8:30am or later) ideal
- Limit evening activities
- Dim lights in evening
- Limit screens before bed
- Consistent schedule on weekends (avoid sleeping in >2 hours)
- Bright light in morning

### Older Adults

**Sleep Changes with Aging**
- Sleep becomes lighter (less deep sleep)
- More frequent awakenings
- Earlier bedtime and wake time (advanced phase)
- Total sleep time slightly decreases (but still need 7-8 hours)
- More daytime napping
- Medications affect sleep

**Common Issues**
- Insomnia more prevalent
- Sleep apnea more common
- Restless legs syndrome
- Periodic limb movements
- Medical conditions interfere (pain, nocturia)

**Recommendations**
- Maintain consistent schedule
- Stay physically active
- Exposure to bright light during day
- Limit daytime naps (20-30 min, before 3pm)
- Review medications with doctor (some interfere)
- Treat underlying conditions

### Pregnancy

**First Trimester**
- Increased sleepiness
- More frequent urination (sleep disruption)
- Nausea

**Second Trimester**
- Usually sleep improves
- Decreased nighttime awakenings
- More energy

**Third Trimester**
- Difficulty finding comfortable position
- Frequent urination returns
- Back pain
- Leg cramps
- Heartburn
- Restless legs syndrome
- Anxiety about delivery

**Recommendations**
- Sleep on left side (improves circulation)
- Pregnancy pillow for support
- Elevate head for heartburn
- Limit fluids before bed
- Naps if needed
- Relaxation techniques
- Iron supplementation if RLS

### Shift Workers

**Challenges**
- Working against circadian rhythm
- Sleeping during biological day
- Light exposure at wrong times
- Social and family disruptions
- Increased health risks

**Health Consequences**
- Chronic sleep deprivation
- Increased risk:
  - Cardiovascular disease
  - Diabetes
  - Obesity
  - Gastrointestinal problems
  - Depression
  - Some cancers

**Coping Strategies**
- **Sleep**: Dark, quiet, cool room during day
- **Light**: Bright light at work, dark sunglasses on commute home
- **Meals**: Healthy meals, avoid heavy food at night
- **Naps**: Strategic napping before or during shift
- **Caffeine**: Early in shift only
- **Schedule**: Maintain consistent sleep times even on days off (if possible)
- **Rotating shifts**: Forward rotation (day→evening→night) better than backward

## Sleep Tracking Interpretation

### Analyzing Patterns

**Look for Trends Over Time**
- Week-to-week patterns
- Sleep debt accumulation
- Variability in schedule
- Impact of lifestyle factors

**Correlate with Behavior**
- Exercise: Timing and intensity
- Caffeine: Amount and timing
- Alcohol: Impact on sleep stages
- Stress: Effects on sleep quality
- Screen time: Late use affecting sleep
- Meals: Heavy evening meals

**Red Flags**
- Consistent difficulty falling asleep
- Frequent long awakenings
- Low sleep efficiency
- Inadequate deep or REM sleep
- High heart rate during sleep (stress, apnea)
- Respiratory rate irregularities

### Actionable Insights

**If Sleep Latency High (>30 min)**
- Review bedtime routine (stimulating activities?)
- Check bedroom environment (light, noise, temperature)
- Assess stress and worry (try relaxation techniques)
- Consider earlier caffeine cutoff
- Try cognitive behavioral strategies

**If Frequent Awakenings**
- Identify causes (noise, light, temperature, partner, bathroom)
- Check for sleep apnea signs (snoring, gasping)
- Review medications (some cause awakenings)
- Assess for pain or discomfort
- Reduce evening fluid intake if nocturia

**If Low Sleep Efficiency**
- Reduce time in bed (sleep restriction)
- Strengthen bed-sleep association (stimulus control)
- Avoid lying awake (get up after 20 min)
- Review daytime habits (exercise, caffeine, naps)

**If Low Deep Sleep**
- Increase daytime physical activity
- Ensure cool bedroom temperature
- Check for sleep apnea (disrupts deep sleep)
- Reduce alcohol before bed
- Manage stress

**If Low REM Sleep**
- Ensure adequate total sleep time (REM later in night)
- Reduce alcohol (suppresses REM)
- Check medications (some suppress REM)
- Improve sleep schedule consistency
- Manage stress and anxiety

2. **Napping too late or too long** - Reduces sleep pressure
3. **Late caffeine** - Blocks sleep signal (cut off by 2pm)
4. **Alcohol as sleep aid** - Disrupts sleep quality
5. **Screens in bed** - Suppresses melatonin, stimulates mind
6. **Forcing sleep** - Creates anxiety, makes worse
7. **Clock watching** - Increases stress
8. **Trying to "catch up"** - Doesn't work, disrupts rhythm
9. **Exercising too close to bed** - Stimulating
10. **Ignoring sleep problems** - Get help if persistent

### Golden Rules of Sleep

1. Your body knows how to sleep - don't overthink it
2. Quality matters as much as quantity
3. Consistency beats perfection
4. Progress not perfection - some nights will be bad
5. Address underlying issues (stress, health, disorders)
6. Sleep is not optional - prioritize it
7. One size doesn't fit all - find what works for you
8. Tracking is tool, not obsession
9. Sleep hygiene helps most people, most of the time
10. When in doubt, keep it simple: regular schedule, dark room, cool temperature, relaxing routine
