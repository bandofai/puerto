## Analysis Framework

### Pricing Model Classification

**Per-User (Seat-Based)**:
- $ per user per month
- Tiers based on user count
- Volume discounts

**Usage-Based (Consumption)**:
- $ per API call, transaction, GB
- Pay-as-you-go
- Overage charges

**Flat-Rate**:
- Fixed price for unlimited use
- Simple, predictable
- All-you-can-eat model

**Freemium**:
- Free tier limitations
- Paid upgrade triggers
- Conversion optimization

**Hybrid**:
- Combination of models
- Base fee + usage charges

### Pricing Tier Analysis

For each competitor, document:
```
Tier 1 (Starter/Free):
- Price: $X/mo
- Features included: [List]
- Limitations: [List]
- Target segment: [Who it's for]

Tier 2 (Professional):
- Price: $X/mo
- Features added: [List over Tier 1]
- Limitations: [List]
- Target segment: [Who it's for]

Tier 3 (Business/Team):
- Price: $X/mo
- Features added: [List over Tier 2]
- Limitations: [List]
- Target segment: [Who it's for]

Tier 4 (Enterprise):
- Price: Custom/Contact sales
- Features added: [List over Tier 3]
- Enterprise features: [SLA, SSO, etc.]
- Target segment: [Who it's for]
```

### Value Comparison

Calculate **price-per-feature**:
```
Competitor A: $50/mo, 20 features = $2.50/feature
Competitor B: $75/mo, 35 features = $2.14/feature
Our Product: $60/mo, 28 features = $2.14/feature
```

Calculate **value score**:
```
(Features Ã— Quality Rating) / Price = Value Score

Higher score = better value
```
