# Competitive Intelligence Skill

**Expert patterns for competitor monitoring and market intelligence analysis**

## Overview

Competitive intelligence is systematic collection and analysis of publicly available information about competitors, markets, and industries to support strategic decision-making.

## Core Principles

### 1. Legal and Ethical Boundaries

**ALWAYS LEGAL**:
- Public websites and pricing pages
- Published financial reports
- Press releases and news articles
- Social media posts
- Customer reviews
- Job postings
- Conference presentations
- Patent filings

**NEVER DO** (Illegal/Unethical):
- Misrepresent identity to gain information
- Hack or unauthorized access
- Bribe employees for secrets
- Industrial espionage
- Violate NDAs or confidentiality

**Best Practice**: If you question legality, don't do it. Stick to publicly available information.

### 2. Information Sources Hierarchy

**Tier 1** (Most Reliable):
- Official company communications
- Regulatory filings (SEC, IPO prospectuses)
- Audited financial statements
- Direct pricing pages

**Tier 2** (Generally Reliable):
- Reputable news sources
- Industry analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester)
- Customer reviews (G2, Capterra)
- Employee reviews (Glassdoor)

**Tier 3** (Use With Caution):
- Social media claims
- Forums and Reddit
- Unverified blog posts
- Competitor claims about themselves

**Tier 4** (Verify Heavily):
- Anonymous sources
- Competitor claims about others
- Rumor sites
- Outdated information

### 3. Triangulation Methodology

Never rely on single source. Validate with 3+ independent sources:

```
Finding: "Competitor X has 10,000 customers"

Source 1: Company website claims "10,000+"
Source 2: Press release states "surpassed 10,000 milestone"
Source 3: CEO interview mentions "five-figure customer base"

Confidence: HIGH (3 sources, consistent)
```

vs.

```
Finding: "Competitor Y losing customers"

Source 1: Single Reddit post complains
Source 2: [No other sources]

Confidence: LOW (1 unverified source)
Action: Mark as "unverified claim", monitor for confirmation
```

## Intelligence Collection Frameworks

### Framework 1: Porter's Five Forces

Assess competitive intensity systematically:

**1. Threat of New Entrants**
- Barriers to entry (high/medium/low)
- Capital requirements
- Regulatory hurdles
- Brand loyalty in market
- Recent new entrants

**2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers**
- Supplier concentration
- Switching costs
- Forward integration threat
- Critical dependencies

**3. Bargaining Power of Buyers**
- Customer concentration
- Switching costs
- Backward integration threat
- Price sensitivity

**4. Threat of Substitutes**
- Alternative solutions
- Price/performance of substitutes
- Switching costs
- Customer propensity to substitute

**5. Competitive Rivalry**
- Number of competitors
- Market growth rate
- Product differentiation
- Exit barriers
- Strategic stakes

### Framework 2: Competitive Profile Matrix

Compare competitors across key success factors:

| Success Factor | Weight | Us | Comp A | Comp B | Comp C |
|---------------|--------|----|----- --|--------|--------|
| Product Quality | 20% | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 |
| Price Competitiveness | 15% | 3 | 5 | 2 | 4 |
| Market Share | 10% | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| Financial Position | 10% | 4 | 5 | 3 | 3 |
| Customer Service | 15% | 5 | 3 | 4 | 4 |
| Brand Reputation | 15% | 4 | 4 | 5 | 2 |
| Technology | 15% | 5 | 3 | 4 | 3 |

**Scoring**: 1 (weak) to 5 (strong)

**Weighted Score** = Σ (Weight × Score)

### Framework 3: SWOT Analysis

For each major competitor:

**Strengths** (Internal, Positive):
- What they do well
- Competitive advantages
- Unique resources
- Strong capabilities

**Weaknesses** (Internal, Negative):
- What they do poorly
- Competitive disadvantages
- Resource limitations
- Capability gaps

**Opportunities** (External, Positive):
- Market trends favoring them
- Unmet customer needs they could address
- Partnerships/acquisitions available
- Regulatory changes helping them

**Threats** (External, Negative):
- Market trends against them
- New competitors entering
- Technology disruption
- Regulatory challenges

### Framework 4: Perceptual Mapping

Plot competitors on 2D axes to visualize positioning:

Common axes:
- Price (low to high) vs. Quality (low to high)
- Features (few to many) vs. Ease of Use (complex to simple)
- Innovation (follower to leader) vs. Reliability (risky to proven)

Insights from map:
- Clusters (who competes directly)
- Gaps (white space opportunities)
- Our position vs. perception
- Movement over time

## Intelligence Analysis Techniques

### Technique 1: Win/Loss Analysis

Track why deals are won or lost to competitors:

**Win Analysis**:
- Which competitor did we beat?
- What were the key decision criteria?
- What tipped the decision our way?
- What almost cost us the deal?

**Loss Analysis**:
- Which competitor won?
- Why did we lose?
- What could have changed the outcome?
- Was it winnable?

**Pattern Detection**:
After 20+ deals, identify:
- Segments where we consistently win/lose
- Features that determine outcomes
- Price sensitivity thresholds
- Unbeatable competitor combinations

### Technique 2: Reverse Engineering

Understand competitor strategies through observable actions:

**Product Analysis**:
- Sign up for trials/free tiers
- Test feature sets systematically
- Document user experience
- Analyze technology stack (BuiltWith, Wappalyzer)

**Pricing Analysis**:
- Map all tiers and features
- Calculate price-per-feature
- Identify psychological pricing tactics
- Track changes over time

**Marketing Analysis**:
- Messaging and positioning
- Target customer segments
- Channel strategy (SEO, paid, content)
- Value propositions

**Sales Process**:
- Trial to paid conversion flow
- Sales touchpoints
- Demo structure

### Technique 3: Signal Detection

Monitor weak signals that predict future moves:

**Hiring Signals**:
- Job postings reveal roadmap
- "Machine Learning Engineer" → AI features coming
- "Enterprise Sales" → moving upmarket
- "Head of Europe" → international expansion

**Partnership Signals**:
- Integrations reveal strategy
- Strategic vs. tactical partners
- Ecosystem plays

**Funding Signals**:
- Series A/B/C milestones

- Social media mentions
- Support forum complaints
- Feature request forums

**Employee Sentiment**:
- Glassdoor reviews
- LinkedIn job tenure
- Hiring velocity
- Executive departures

**Market Sentiment**:
- Analyst reports
- Press coverage tone
- Industry award wins

## Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Use official sources whenever possible
✅ Triangulate findings with multiple sources
✅ Track changes over time (trends > snapshots)
✅ Focus on strategic implications, not just facts
✅ Make intelligence actionable
✅ Update regularly (intelligence ages quickly)
✅ Maintain source attribution
✅ Distinguish fact from inference

### DON'T:
❌ Rely on single unverified sources
❌ Collect intelligence without analysis
❌ Hoard intelligence (share with stakeholders)
❌ Let intelligence get stale (>90 days)
❌ Ignore small competitors (can grow fast)
❌ Cross ethical/legal lines
❌ Assume competitor irrationality (assume smart)
❌ Forget about indirect competitors

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Analysis Paralysis**
- Collecting data endlessly without acting
- **Fix**: Set intelligence questions upfront, collect to answer them

**Pitfall 2: Confirmation Bias**
- Seeking information that confirms existing beliefs
- **Fix**: Actively seek disconfirming evidence

**Pitfall 3: Recency Bias**
- Overweighting recent events vs. long-term patterns
- **Fix**: Trend analysis over time, not point-in-time snapshots

**Pitfall 4: Competitor Obsession**
- Copying competitors instead of innovating
- **Fix**: Balance competitor intel with customer insight

**Pitfall 5: Intelligence Hoarding**
- Keeping findings to self/team instead of sharing
- **Fix**: Regular intelligence briefs to stakeholders

## Summary Checklist

For any competitive intelligence work:

- [ ] Intelligence questions defined upfront
- [ ] Sources are ethical and legal
- [ ] Multiple sources triangulated (3+ for key claims)
- [ ] Source tier assessed (Tier 1 > Tier 4)
- [ ] Strategic implications identified
- [ ] Actionable recommendations provided
- [ ] Threat levels assigned with justification
- [ ] Monitoring plan established
- [ ] Stakeholders briefed
- [ ] Next review date set

**Remember**: Intelligence is only valuable if it's timely, accurate, and actionable. Focus on insights that drive decisions, not data for data's sake.
