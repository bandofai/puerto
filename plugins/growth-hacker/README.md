# Growth Hacker Plugin

Growth strategy and experimentation specialist for creating viral loops, optimizing acquisition channels, improving retention, and designing referral programs.

## Overview

The Growth Hacker plugin provides agents for systematic growth using proven frameworks: AARRR (Pirate Metrics), viral coefficient optimization, North Star Metric identification, and data-driven experimentation.

## Agents

### 1. experiment-designer (Sonnet, Skill-Aware)
Designs growth experiments with hypotheses, success metrics, sample sizes, and statistical rigor.

**Use for**: Growth experiment planning, hypothesis testing, A/B tests, feature launches

**Example**:
```
Use experiment-designer to test onboarding improvement.
Hypothesis: Adding social proof in onboarding increases activation by 20%
Current activation: 40% (complete setup within 7 days)
Variant: Add "Join 50,000+ users" badge and customer logos
Success metric: Activation rate
Sample size: 5,000 users per variant (80% power, 95% confidence)
Duration: 2 weeks
Analysis: Two-proportion z-test
```

### 2. viral-architect (Sonnet, Skill-Aware, WebSearch)
Designs viral loops and mechanisms to achieve organic user acquisition through referrals.

**Use for**: Viral loop design, K-factor optimization, referral mechanics, sharing incentives

**Example**:
```
Use viral-architect to create viral loop for SaaS product.
Product: Team collaboration tool
Current users: 10,000 (K-factor: 0.3, need >1.0 for viral growth)
Viral mechanisms:
- Invite team members (collaboration required = inherent virality)
- Share boards publicly (content-driven virality)
- Referral rewards (incentivized virality)
Goal: Increase K-factor to 1.2+ for exponential growth
Include: Cycle time reduction, conversion rate optimization, incentive design
```

### 3. acquisition-optimizer (Sonnet, Skill-Aware, WebSearch)
Optimizes acquisition channels: paid ads, SEO, content, partnerships, product-led growth.

**Use for**: Channel analysis, CAC optimization, LTV:CAC improvement, channel mix

**Example**:
```
Use acquisition-optimizer to improve customer acquisition.
Current channels:
- Google Ads: $150 CAC, 200 customers/month
- Content SEO: $50 CAC, 100 customers/month
- Partnerships: $80 CAC, 50 customers/month
Target: Reduce blended CAC from $120 to $80
LTV: $500 (LTV:CAC currently 4.2, target 6+)
Analysis:
- Channel efficiency and scalability
- Budget reallocation recommendations
- New channel opportunities (PLG, community, etc.)
```

### 4. retention-specialist (Sonnet, Skill-Aware)
Optimizes user retention through cohort analysis, engagement loops, and churn prevention.

**Use for**: Cohort analysis, churn reduction, engagement optimization, reactivation

**Example**:
```
Use retention-specialist to reduce churn for SaaS.
Retention metrics:
- D1: 80%, D7: 50%, D30: 30% (poor D7→D30 retention)
- Monthly churn: 8% (high for SaaS)
Cohort analysis: Users who complete onboarding have 2x better D30 retention
Strategies:
- Activation improvement (get to "aha moment" faster)
- Engagement loops (daily/weekly habits)
- Win-back campaigns (reactivate churned users)
- Feature adoption (increase stickiness)
```

## Growth Metrics

### Acquisition
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**: Total marketing spend / new customers
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)**: ARPU × average lifetime (months)
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: 3:1 minimum, 6:1+ excellent
- **Payback Period**: Months to recover CAC (< 12 months ideal)

### Activation
- **Activation Rate**: % reaching "aha moment" or key milestone
- **Time to Value**: Hours/days to first value
- **Onboarding Completion**: % completing setup

### Retention
- **Retention Curves**: D1, D7, D30, D90 retention %
- **Churn Rate**: Monthly churn (5-7% acceptable for SaaS, <2% excellent)
- **Cohort Retention**: Retention by signup date cohort

### Viral/Referral
- **K-factor (Viral Coefficient)**: Invites sent × conversion rate (>1.0 = viral growth)
- **Viral Cycle Time**: Days from signup to referral
- **Referral Rate**: % of users who refer others

## Growth Frameworks

### AARRR (Pirate Metrics)
1. **Acquisition**: How users find you (channels, CAC)
2. **Activation**: First experience and "aha moment"
3. **Retention**: Users coming back (engagement loops)
4. **Revenue**: Monetization and pricing
5. **Referral**: Users bringing more users (viral growth)

### North Star Metric
Single metric that best predicts long-term success:
- **Marketplace**: Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)
- **SaaS**: Weekly Active Users completing core action
- **Social**: Daily Active Users creating content
- **E-commerce**: Monthly purchasers

### Viral Growth Formula
```
K-factor = Invites per user × Conversion rate
K > 1.0 = Exponential viral growth
K = 0.5 = 50% of growth is viral, 50% paid

Cycle time: Time from signup to referral
Goal: High K-factor + short cycle time
```
