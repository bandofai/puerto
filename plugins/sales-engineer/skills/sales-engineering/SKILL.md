### 4.3 ROI Calculation Best Practices

**DO**:
✅ Use conservative estimates (better to under-promise, over-deliver)
✅ Show sensitivity analysis (what if assumptions are off)
✅ Include hard AND soft benefits (be transparent)
✅ Factor in ramp-up/adoption curve (not instant value)
✅ Include all costs (implementation, ongoing, internal labor)
✅ Use client's own data and metrics
✅ Provide scenario analysis (conservative, realistic, optimistic)
✅ Show payback period (executives care about this)
✅ Include risk mitigation (acknowledge uncertainties)

**DON'T**:
❌ Inflate benefits to make numbers look better
❌ Ignore implementation and change management costs
❌ Assume 100% adoption on day 1
❌ Double-count benefits
❌ Use only "soft" benefits (need hard numbers)
❌ Ignore time value of money (use NPV)
❌ Present single-point estimates (show ranges)
❌ Forget about ongoing costs

**Conservative Adjustments**:
- Productivity gains: Use 60-70% of theoretical maximum
- Adoption curve: Assume gradual (not instant)
- Revenue benefits: Discount heavily (hardest to prove)
- Cost savings: Use only verifiable savings
- Contingency: Add 10-20% to costs

### 5.2 Handling Difficult Questions

**When you DON'T know the answer**:

**❌ WRONG**:
- Guessing or making up an answer
- "I think it might be..."
- Deflecting or changing the subject
- "That's not important"

**✅ RIGHT**:
"That's an excellent question. I want to give you accurate information, so let me verify the specifics with our [engineering/product/security] team and get back to you by [timeframe]. In the meantime, here's what I do know about [related topic]..."

**When the answer is "No, we don't support that"**:

**❌ WRONG**:
- "No" (end of discussion)
- Making excuses
- Disparaging the request

**✅ RIGHT**:
"We don't currently support [feature] out of the box, but let me understand your use case better. [Ask clarifying questions]. Here are some options:
1. We can build this as a custom extension (timeline: [X], cost: $[Y])
2. We have workaround [Z] that achieves [similar outcome]
3. This is on our roadmap for [quarter/year]
4. We integrate with [third-party tool] that provides this capability

Which approach would best fit your needs?"

**When asked about competitors**:

**❌ WRONG**:
- Disparaging competitors
- "They're terrible"
- Claiming they lie
- Getting defensive

**✅ RIGHT**:
"[Competitor] is a solid product, and many of our customers actually evaluated them. Here's what we hear from customers who chose us:
- **Differentiation 1**: We offer [unique capability] which matters for [use case]
- **Differentiation 2**: Our approach to [feature] is [different/better] because [reason]
- **Customer success**: [Specific example of customer success]

The choice often comes down to [specific criteria]. What's most important to you?"

**When asked about pricing before qualification**:

**❌ WRONG**:
- Refusing to discuss pricing
- Giving a number that's way off
- "It depends" (without context)

**✅ RIGHT**:
"I want to give you accurate pricing tailored to your needs. Our pricing is based on [users/volume/modules/etc.], and typically ranges from $[X] to $[Y] annually for companies your size. To give you an exact quote, I need to understand:
1. [Sizing question]
2. [Feature question]
3. [Integration question]

Can we walk through these quickly, and then I'll provide a detailed quote?"

**When asked about roadmap commitments**:

**❌ WRONG**:
- Promising features that don't exist
- "Sure, we can build that" (without verification)
- Giving specific dates without authority

**✅ RIGHT**:
"[Feature] is currently on our roadmap for [timeframe], but I cannot commit to specific delivery dates. What I can do is:
1. Connect you with our Product team to influence prioritization
2. Explore whether this could be a custom development
3. Document this as a requirement in your contract

How critical is this feature to your decision? If it's a must-have, let's discuss options."

2. **ROI**: Based on our analysis, you'll see payback in [X] months and [Y]% ROI over 3 years
3. **Risk of inaction**: What's the cost of NOT solving this problem? [Quantify]
4. **Flexible options**: We have [financing/phased approach/different editions] that may fit your budget

What aspect of the cost is most concerning to you?"

**Objection: "We're happy with our current solution"**

Response:
"That's great that you have a working solution. May I ask a few questions to understand better?
- What do you like most about your current solution?
- If you could improve one thing, what would it be?
- How does it handle [known limitation]?
- What are your plans as you [scale/expand/etc.]?

Even if you're happy today, it's worth understanding what else is available as your needs evolve. Can I show you how we approach [specific capability] differently?"

"[Competitor] is a solid choice, and I respect your decision. Before you finalize, may I ask:
- What were the key deciding factors?
- Was there anything we could have done differently?
- Are there any remaining concerns about [Competitor] I could help you think through?

If [Competitor] doesn't work out, I'd love to reconnect. And I'm happy to serve as a reference point if you have questions during your evaluation."

**Objection: "We need feature X that you don't have"**

Response:
"I appreciate you being clear about your requirements. Let me explore this:
1. **Tell me more**: How do you envision using this feature? What problem does it solve?
2. **Alternatives**: We approach this differently with [alternative feature]. Would that meet your needs?
3. **Custom development**: If this is critical, we can scope this as a custom extension. Timeline would be [X], cost around $[Y]
4. **Roadmap**: This is actually on our roadmap for [timeframe]. Would you be willing to start with [workaround] until then?
