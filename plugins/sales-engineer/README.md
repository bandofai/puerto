## Troubleshooting

### Agent Doesn't Activate

**Issue**: Agent doesn't automatically invoke when needed

**Solutions**:
- Try explicit request: "Please use the sales-engineer agent to create..."
- Check agent is installed: `ls ~/.claude/agents/sales-engineer.md`
- Verify trigger phrases in request (demo, technical document, ROI, architecture)

### Low-Quality Output

**Issue**: Output is generic or doesn't meet professional standards

**Solutions**:
- Ensure skill is installed: `ls ~/.claude/skills/sales-engineering/SKILL.md`
- Agent MUST read skill first - verify this happens
- Provide more context about client (industry, pain points, technical level)
- Request specific output format or template

### Missing Document Skills

**Issue**: Word/Excel/PowerPoint output not professionally formatted

**Solutions**:
- Install document skills separately:
  ```bash
  # These are optional but recommended
  # Check Claude Code docs for docx, pptx, xlsx skills
  ```
- Agent will still create documents using best practices from sales-engineering skill
- Markdown alternatives will be used if document skills unavailable

### Inaccurate Technical Claims

**Issue**: Technical details in output seem incorrect

**Solutions**:
- Provide accurate product information (links to docs, specifications)
- Agent may not have current product knowledge - supplement with context
- Review and edit output before sending to clients
- Use agent as starting point, not final deliverable without review

### ROI Model Seems Optimistic

**Issue**: ROI calculations appear too aggressive

**Solutions**:
- Review assumptions tab in Excel output
- Adjust conservative estimates (agent defaults to 60-70% of theoretical max)
- Use sensitivity analysis to show ranges
- Provide client's actual baseline data for more accurate calculations

## Customization

### Adding Company-Specific Templates

Create project-level skill with company templates:

```bash
# Create company-specific skill (inherits from main skill)
mkdir -p .claude/skills/sales-engineering-company/
cat > .claude/skills/sales-engineering-company/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
# Company-Specific Sales Engineering Patterns

## Company Templates

### Technical Overview Template
[Your company's standard template]

### Demo Script Template
[Your company's format]

### ROI Model Assumptions
[Your company's standard assumptions]

## Product Information
[Current product capabilities, limitations, roadmap]

## Competitive Positioning
[How to position against competitors]

## Pricing Guidelines
[Standard pricing, discounting authority]
EOF
```

Agent will read company-specific skill first (project-level overrides user-level).

### Adding Industry Templates

Extend skill with additional industry patterns:

```bash
# Add to .claude/skills/sales-engineering/SKILL.md or create separate file

## Part 9: [Your Industry]

### Key Concerns
- [Industry-specific regulation]
- [Industry-specific integration needs]

### Vocabulary
- [Industry-specific terms]

### Common Questions
[Q&A pairs specific to industry]

### ROI Focus
- [Industry-specific ROI drivers]
```

## Integration with Sales Process

### Sales Stage Workflow

**Discovery → Solution Design → Evaluation → Business Case → Close**

1. **Discovery**: Answer technical questions, provide overview
2. **Solution Design**: Create architecture proposal, demo preparation
3. **Evaluation**: POC plan, detailed technical docs
4. **Business Case**: ROI calculation, TCO analysis
5. **Close**: Security docs, implementation plan

### Handoff to Sales Team

Agent provides:
- Executive summary for sales rep
- Technical talking points
- Open questions log
- Recommended next steps
- CRM update notes (if requested)

### Metrics to Track

- Win rate improvement (baseline vs. with agent)
