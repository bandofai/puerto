  "notes": "This is an example warranty database showing different product types, warranty statuses, and claim tracking. Use this as a template for organizing your warranties.\n\nTips:\n- Always register products when registration is required (it's often needed to activate full warranty)\n- Set expiration alerts to 30-60 days before warranty ends (gives you time to test product and file claims if needed)\n- Keep all receipts and documentation organized in the documents folder\n- Update warranty status and claims regularly\n- Take photos of serial numbers when you first purchase products\n- Save warranty terms PDFs - companies sometimes change terms on their websites\n\nCommon Warranty Durations by Category:\n- Electronics (TVs, laptops, phones): 1 year manufacturer\n- Major appliances (refrigerators, washers): 1 year parts & labor, longer for sealed systems\n- Small appliances (vacuums, coffee makers): 1-2 years\n- Vehicles: 3-5 years / 36,000-60,000 miles\n- Home systems (HVAC, water heaters): 5-10 years for parts, 1 year for labor\n\nWhen to Consider Extended Warranties:\n- High-value items ($1000+)\n- Items prone to failure (appliances with complex electronics)\n- Items you use daily and can't be without\n- Items expensive to repair out-of-warranty\n\nWhen to Skip Extended Warranties:\n- Low-value items (under $200)\n- Items with long manufacturer warranties already\n- Items unlikely to fail (simple mechanical items)\n- Items that may become obsolete before warranty expires"
