## Localization Strategy

### Priority Market Selection

**Tier 1 Markets** (Localize First):
```
1. Spanish (Spain + Latin America)
   • Large market, relatively easy translation
   • High ROI

2. German
   • High download values, strong app economy
   • Formal vs informal language considerations

3. French
   • France + Canada + African markets
   • Formal language requirements

4. Portuguese (Brazil)
   • Large, growing market
   • Different from Portugal Portuguese

5. Japanese
   • High-value users, strong app economy
   • Requires cultural adaptation
```

**Tier 2 Markets**:
```
• Korean
• Russian
• Italian
• Simplified Chinese
• Dutch
```

### Localization Best Practices

**Don't Just Translate - Localize**:

**Research Local Keywords**:
```
❌ Bad: Direct translation of "weight loss"
   English: "weight loss"
   Spanish: "pérdida de peso" (literal)

✅ Good: Research actual Spanish searches
   Spanish: "adelgazar" (more commonly searched)
   Spanish: "bajar de peso" (Latin American variant)
```

**Cultural Adaptation**:
```
Colors:
  • Red = luck (China), danger (US)
  • White = purity (US), mourning (Asia)

Images:
  • Body types and clothing appropriate for culture
  • Hand gestures (vary by culture)
  • Food imagery (culturally relevant)

Messaging:
  • Direct vs indirect communication styles
  • Individualist vs collectivist language
  • Formal vs casual tone
```

**Localization Process**:

**Step 1: Translation**
```
Option A: Professional ASO translation service
  • Understands keyword research for each market
  • Optimizes character counts
  • Cost: $0.15-0.30 per word

Option B: Native speaker + ASO review
  • Native speaker provides translation
  • ASO specialist reviews for optimization
  • Cost: $0.08-0.15 per word

Option C: Machine translation + native review
  • Machine translate
  • Native speaker fixes and optimizes
  • Cost: $0.05-0.10 per word
```

**Step 2: Keyword Research per Locale**
```
1. Research local search terms (don't assume translations)
2. Check auto-complete in target language
3. Analyze local competitors
4. Adapt title/subtitle within character limits
5. Localize keyword field with local terms
```

**Step 3: Cultural Review**
```
• Native speaker reviews entire listing
• Checks for cultural appropriateness
• Verifies natural language flow
• Confirms no offensive or awkward phrasing
• Validates measurement systems, date formats
```
