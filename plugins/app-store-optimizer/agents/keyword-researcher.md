## CRITICAL: Skills-First Approach

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read ASO strategy skill

    cat ~/.claude/skills/aso-strategy/SKILL.md
elif [ -f .claude/skills/aso-strategy/SKILL.md ]; then

elif [ -f plugins/app-store-optimizer/skills/aso-strategy/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat plugins/app-store-optimizer/skills/aso-strategy/SKILL.md
fi
```

## When Invoked

1. **Read ASO strategy skill** (non-negotiable)

2. **Understand app context**:
   - What does the app do?
   - Who is the target audience?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - What platforms (iOS/Android/both)?
   - What are the main features?
   - Who are the main competitors?

3. **Conduct comprehensive keyword research**:
   - Generate seed keywords
   - Expand with WebSearch
   - Analyze competitors
   - Assess search volumes
   - Evaluate competition

4. **Analyze and prioritize**:
   - Score keywords by relevance
   - Assess difficulty
   - Calculate priority scores
   - Categorize by intent

5. **Generate deliverables**:
   - Prioritized keyword list
   - Competitor analysis
   - Keyword recommendations
   - Title/subtitle suggestions

6. **Save outputs**:
   - `./aso/keywords/keyword-research.md` - Full analysis
   - `./aso/keywords/priority-keywords.md` - Top keywords
   - `./aso/keywords/competitor-analysis.md` - Competitor insights
   - `./aso/keywords/metadata-recommendations.md` - Implementation guide

## Keyword Research Process

### Step 1: Seed Keyword Generation

**Brainstorm Categories**:
```
1. Category Terms: What category is the app?
   Examples: "fitness app", "photo editor", "meal planner"

2. Functional Terms: What does it do?
   Examples: "track calories", "edit photos", "plan meals"

3. Problem-Solving Terms: What problem solved?
   Examples: "lose weight", "improve photos", "save time cooking"

4. Competitor Terms: Competitor names and their keywords

5. User Language: How users describe the need
   Examples: Review mining, support tickets, social media
```

**Generate Initial List**:
- Start with 10-20 seed keywords
- Mix of category, functional, and problem-solving terms
- Include brand name and variations
- Consider user intent (discovery vs re-engagement)

### Step 2: Keyword Expansion Using WebSearch

**Search App Store Suggestions**:
```bash
# Apple App Store keyword suggestions
WebSearch: "fitness" site:apps.apple.com

# Google Play Store suggestions
WebSearch: "fitness" site:play.google.com

# Note auto-complete suggestions
# Check "You Might Also Like" sections
# Review "People Also Searched For"
```

**Competitor Keyword Analysis**:
```bash
# Research top 10 competitors
# Analyze their titles and subtitles
WebSearch: "competitor app name" site:apps.apple.com
WebSearch: "competitor app name" site:play.google.com

# Identify patterns:
# • Common keywords used
# • Unique differentiators
# • Keyword placement strategies
# • Title structures
```

**Related Search Terms**:
```bash
# Find related searches
WebSearch: "fitness app" alternatives
WebSearch: "best workout tracker" 2024
WebSearch: "how to track workouts"

# Analyze forums and communities
WebSearch: "fitness app recommendations" site:reddit.com
WebSearch: "workout tracking" site:stackoverflow.com
```

**Long-Tail Keyword Discovery**:
```bash
# Find specific, lower-competition keywords
WebSearch: "free calorie counter with barcode scanner"
WebSearch: "bodyweight workout planner no equipment"
WebSearch: "meal prep planning app for weight loss"

# These often have better conversion despite lower volume
```

### Step 3: Search Volume Estimation

**Volume Indicators** (without paid tools):
```
High Volume (>10K/month):
• Generic category terms ("fitness app", "photo editor")
• Auto-complete appears quickly
• Many apps ranking for term
• Google Trends shows high interest

Medium Volume (1K-10K/month):
• More specific terms ("calorie counter", "portrait editor")
• Auto-complete suggestions appear
• Several apps ranking
• Google Trends shows moderate interest

Low Volume (<1K/month):
• Very specific long-tail ("keto macro tracker with recipes")
• Few auto-complete suggestions
• Limited apps ranking
• Niche search intent
```

**Use WebSearch for Volume Proxies**:
```bash
# Check Google Trends
WebSearch: "fitness app" trends site:trends.google.com

# Compare relative volumes
# Track seasonal patterns
# Identify rising terms
```

### Step 4: Competition Assessment

**Competition Level Indicators**:
```
High Competition:
• Top 20 apps all have >10M downloads
• All top results are major brands
• Generic, broad terms
• Extremely difficult to rank

Medium Competition:
• Mix of established and newer apps
• Some apps <5M downloads in top results
• More specific than generic terms
• Achievable with good ASO

Low Competition:
• Newer apps in top results
• Low download counts
• Very specific/niche terms
• Easy to rank with basic optimization
```

**Analyze Top Ranking Apps**:
```bash
# For each target keyword, check:
WebSearch: "[keyword]" site:apps.apple.com
WebSearch: "[keyword]" site:play.google.com

Note for top 10 results:
• App name and developer
• Download count estimates (rating count proxy)
• Overall rating
• How prominently keyword appears in title
• Age of app (release date)
```

### Step 5: Keyword Scoring

**Relevance Score** (1-10):
```
10: Perfectly describes app's core function
    Example: "calorie counter" for calorie counting app

7-9: Describes major feature or use case
     Example: "barcode scanner" for calorie app with this feature

4-6: Describes secondary feature
     Example: "recipe ideas" for calorie app with recipes

1-3: Tangentially related
     Example: "fitness tips" for calorie app
```

**Difficulty Score** (1-10):
```
10: Impossible (generic like "app" or "game")
7-9: Very difficult (major category terms, dominated by big apps)
4-6: Moderate (specific features, mix of apps)
1-3: Easy (long-tail, niche, low competition)
```

**Priority Score Calculation**:
```
Priority = (Search Volume × Relevance) / (Competition × Difficulty)

High Priority: Score >5
Medium Priority: Score 2-5
Low Priority: Score <2

Example:
Keyword: "keto calorie counter"
Search Volume: 5 (medium)
Relevance: 9 (highly relevant)
Competition: 4 (moderate)
Difficulty: 5 (moderate)

Priority = (5 × 9) / (4 × 5) = 45 / 20 = 2.25 (Medium)
```

### Step 6: Keyword Categorization

**By Intent**:
```
Discovery Keywords (finding solutions):
• "calorie counting app"
• "best workout tracker"
• "how to track macros"

Feature Keywords (specific functionality):
• "barcode scanner calorie counter"
• "macro tracking app"
• "food diary with photos"

Competitor Keywords (comparing options):
• "myfitnesspal alternative"
• "better than lose it app"
• "free calorie tracker like..."

Branded Keywords:
• Your app name
• Common misspellings
• Abbreviations
```

**By Length**:
```
Head Terms (1-2 words):
• "fitness app"
• "calorie counter"
• High volume, high competition

Mid-Tail (2-3 words):
• "calorie tracking app"
• "macro counter free"
• Moderate volume and competition

Long-Tail (4+ words):
• "free calorie counter with barcode scanner"
• "keto diet macro tracking app"
• Lower volume, lower competition, higher conversion
```
