## ASO Fundamentals

### What is ASO?

App Store Optimization is the process of improving an app's visibility in app stores and increasing conversion rates from views to installs.

**Two Core Components**:
1. **Visibility**: Getting found in search and browse
2. **Conversion**: Turning views into installs

**Primary Ranking Factors**:
- **Keywords**: Title, subtitle, keyword field (iOS), description (Android)
- **Downloads**: Volume and velocity of installs
- **Ratings & Reviews**: Quantity, quality, recency
- **Engagement**: Usage metrics, retention, uninstalls
- **Update Frequency**: Regular updates signal active development

### Apple App Store vs Google Play Store

| Element | Apple App Store | Google Play Store |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Title Length** | 30 characters | 30 characters |
| **Subtitle** | 30 characters | Not available |
| **Short Description** | Not available | 80 characters |
| **Description** | Not indexed for search | Indexed for search (4,000 chars) |
| **Keyword Field** | 100 characters (private) | Not available |
| **Promotional Text** | 170 characters (not indexed) | Not available |
| **Screenshots** | Up to 10 | Up to 8 |
| **App Preview** | 3 videos per localization | 1 video |
| **Ratings Display** | Current version + all versions | All versions only |
| **A/B Testing** | Product Page Optimization | Google Experiments |

## Keyword Research Methodology

### Step 1: Brainstorm Seed Keywords

**Core Categories**:
1. **Category Terms**: What category is your app in?
   - Examples: "fitness app", "photo editor", "recipe app"

2. **Functional Terms**: What does your app do?
   - Examples: "track calories", "edit photos", "find recipes"

3. **Problem-Solving Terms**: What problem does it solve?
   - Examples: "lose weight", "improve photos", "meal planning"

4. **Competitor Terms**: What are competitors called?
   - Examples: competitor brand names, competitor features

5. **User Language**: How do users describe the need?
   - Examples: Check reviews, forums, social media

### Step 2: Expand Keyword List

**Research Sources**:

**App Store Suggestions**:
```
1. Search app stores with seed keywords
2. Note auto-complete suggestions
3. Check "You Might Also Like" section
4. Review competitor keyword usage
```

**Competitor Analysis**:
```
1. Identify top 10 competitors
2. Analyze their titles and subtitles
3. Review their descriptions (Android)
4. Check their keyword rankings (use tools)
5. Note patterns in their visual assets
```

**Third-Party Tools** (if available):
- App Annie / Sensor Tower: Traffic estimates
- AppTweak / Mobile Action: Keyword suggestions
- Google Keyword Planner: Search volumes
- App Store search suggestions: Real user queries

**User Research**:
- App review mining: What terms do users use?
- Support ticket analysis: How do users describe issues?
- Social media listening: How do people talk about the category?
- Survey customers: What would they search for?

### Step 3: Keyword Evaluation Metrics

**Search Volume**: How many people search this term?
- **High** (>10K/month): Very competitive
- **Medium** (1K-10K/month): Moderate competition
- **Low** (<1K/month): Niche opportunity

**Relevance Score** (1-10):
- 10: Perfectly describes app's core function
- 7-9: Describes major feature or use case
- 4-6: Describes secondary feature
- 1-3: Tangentially related

**Competition Level**:
- **High**: Dominated by major apps (>10M downloads)
- **Medium**: Mix of established and new apps
- **Low**: Opportunity for ranking

**Difficulty Score** (1-10):
- 10: Impossible to rank (generic terms like "game")
- 7-9: Very difficult (major category terms)
- 4-6: Moderate difficulty (specific features)
- 1-3: Easy to rank (long-tail, niche terms)

**Priority Formula**:
```
Priority Score = (Search Volume √ó Relevance) / (Competition √ó Difficulty)

Target keywords with highest priority scores
```

### Step 4: Keyword Categories

**Head Terms** (1-2 words):
- Example: "fitness app", "photo editor"
- Characteristics: High volume, high competition
- Strategy: Include in title if highly relevant

**Mid-Tail Terms** (2-3 words):
- Example: "calorie tracking app", "portrait photo editor"
- Characteristics: Moderate volume, moderate competition
- Strategy: Primary focus for most apps

**Long-Tail Terms** (4+ words):
- Example: "free calorie counter with barcode scanner"
- Characteristics: Low volume, low competition
- Strategy: Include multiple in descriptions/keywords

**Branded Terms**:
- Your brand name and variations
- Always include, even if not searched often
- Protects against competitor hijacking

## Screenshot Optimization

### Screenshot Strategy

**Purpose Hierarchy**:
1. **Communicate value** at a glance (most important)
2. **Show key features** in action
3. **Differentiate** from competitors
4. **Build trust** through polish and professionalism
5. **Drive installs** through compelling visuals

**Screenshot Types**:

**1. Hero Screenshot** (First position - most critical):
```
Purpose: Communicate core value proposition
Content:
  ‚Ä¢ Large, bold headline (user benefit)
  ‚Ä¢ Minimal UI or hero image
  ‚Ä¢ Clear emotional appeal
  ‚Ä¢ Brand colors and style

Example Headlines:

```

**3. Social Proof Screenshot** (Position 4-6):
```
Purpose: Build credibility and trust

  ‚Ä¢ User testimonials with photos
  ‚Ä¢ Press mentions and awards
  ‚Ä¢ User count and ratings

### Screenshot Design Principles

**Text Overlay Guidelines**:
- ‚úÖ 40% text maximum per screenshot
- ‚úÖ Large, readable fonts (32pt+ for headlines)
- ‚úÖ High contrast for readability
- ‚úÖ Consistent brand colors and fonts
- ‚úÖ Benefit-focused headlines
- ‚ùå Don't cover critical UI elements
- ‚ùå Don't use small fonts
- ‚ùå Don't use low-contrast text

**Device Mockup Strategy**:
```
Option A: Full phone mockup
  Pros: Shows realistic context, familiar
  Cons: Less screen space for UI

Option B: Screen-only (no device frame)
  Pros: Maximizes UI visibility
  Cons: Less realistic, harder to read on phone

Recommendation:
  ‚Ä¢ Portrait apps: Full mockup
  ‚Ä¢ Landscape apps: Screen-only or landscape mockup
  ‚Ä¢ Games: Screen-only for immersion
```

**Color Psychology**:
- **Blue**: Trust, professionalism (finance, health)
- **Green**: Growth, wellness (fitness, health)
- **Red**: Urgency, excitement (games, deals)
- **Purple**: Creativity, premium (design, luxury)
- **Orange**: Energy, friendliness (social, food)
- **White/Minimal**: Elegance, simplicity (productivity)

**Localization**:
- ‚úÖ Translate all text overlays
- ‚úÖ Adjust layouts for text length differences
- ‚úÖ Use culturally appropriate images
- ‚úÖ Consider color meanings across cultures
- ‚ùå Don't just translate titles/descriptions without screenshots

### Screenshot Testing

**A/B Test Variables**:
```
1. Order: Which screenshot converts best in position 1?
2. Headlines: Benefit vs feature focus
3. Device: Mockup vs no mockup
4. Background: Light vs dark
5. Text amount: Minimal vs descriptive
6. UI vs lifestyle: App interface vs people using app
```

**Testing Process**:
```
1. Create 2-3 screenshot variants

## App Icon Design Principles

### Icon Best Practices

**Recognition Over Detail**:
- ‚úÖ Simple, bold design recognizable at small sizes
- ‚úÖ 1-3 colors maximum
- ‚úÖ Single focal point
- ‚úÖ Strong silhouette (recognizable in black/white)
- ‚ùå Don't include text (illegible at small sizes)
- ‚ùå Don't use complex gradients or shadows
- ‚ùå Don't use photos

**Category Conventions**:
```
Productivity: Blue, minimalist, geometric
Social: Bright colors, speech bubbles, connections
Games: Detailed characters, action, excitement
Health: Green/blue, hearts, activity symbols
Finance: Green/blue, upward trends, security
Photo: Colorful, camera/lens imagery
```

**Stand Out vs Fit In**:
```
Study top 20 apps in your category:
‚Ä¢ What colors dominate? (Maybe avoid or embrace)
‚Ä¢ What styles are common? (Skeuomorphic vs flat)
‚Ä¢ What symbols are overused? (Avoid clich√©s)
‚Ä¢ Where are the gaps? (Opportunity to differentiate)
```

**Testing Icons**:
```
1. View at actual size (iOS: 120x120px, Android: 192x192px)
2. Test on different backgrounds (light/dark mode)
3. Compare against competitors in grid view
4. Check in various app store contexts
5. Show to target audience for feedback
```

### Icon Don'ts

Common Mistakes:
- ‚ùå Using gradients that look muddy at small sizes
- ‚ùå Including fine details that disappear
- ‚ùå Text in icon (illegible and often rejected)
- ‚ùå Copying competitor icons too closely
- ‚ùå Using too many colors (overwhelming)
- ‚ùå Complex shapes (unclear focal point)
- ‚ùå Trendy design that dates quickly

---

## App Preview Video Optimization

### Video Best Practices

**Structure** (iOS: 15-30 seconds, Android: 30-120 seconds):
```
0-3 seconds: Hook
  ‚Ä¢ Show compelling outcome or problem
  ‚Ä¢ No logos or slow intros
  ‚Ä¢ Start with action

3-15 seconds: Key Features
  ‚Ä¢ Demonstrate 2-3 core features
  ‚Ä¢ Show UI in action
  ‚Ä¢ Focus on benefits, not clicks

15-30 seconds: Call to Action
  ‚Ä¢ Reinforce value proposition
  ‚Ä¢ Social proof (optional)
  ‚Ä¢ End on "Download Now" prompt
```

**Hook Examples**:
```
‚úÖ "Losing weight doesn't have to mean giving up pizza"
   [Shows user logging pizza and staying in calories]

‚úÖ "Can't sleep? We've helped 5 million people like you"
   [Shows person falling asleep peacefully]

‚ùå "Welcome to MyApp. Let me show you how it works..."
   [Slow, generic, unengaging]
```

**Video Production Guidelines**:
- ‚úÖ Vertical orientation (portrait apps)
- ‚úÖ Landscape for landscape apps/games
- ‚úÖ High resolution (1080p minimum)
- ‚úÖ Upbeat, positive music
- ‚úÖ Silent viewing friendly (captions/text)
- ‚úÖ Fast-paced (cut every 2-3 seconds)
- ‚ùå Don't use shaky hand recordings
- ‚ùå Don't include audio-only explanations
- ‚ùå Don't show multiple features for too long

**Platform Differences**:

**iOS (App Preview)**:
- Autoplays on mute
- 3 videos per localization
- Separate versions per device size
- First 2-3 seconds critical (preview frame)

**Google Play (Promo Video)**:
- YouTube hosted
- Single video
- Must be unlisted/public
- Plays with sound if user taps
- Can be longer and more detailed

Messaging:
  ‚úÖ "Enjoying MyApp? Rate us!"

```

**Two-Step Approach**:

This prevents sending unhappy users to app store
```

### Localization Process

**Step 1: Translation**:
```
Option A: Professional translation service
  Pros: High quality, cultural adaptation
  Cons: Expensive ($0.10-0.30 per word)
  Best for: Major markets, critical content

Option B: Native speaker (freelancer)
  Pros: Authentic, affordable
  Cons: May lack ASO expertise
  Best for: Tier 2-3 markets

Option C: Machine translation + review
  Pros: Fast, cheap
  Cons: Often awkward phrasing
  Best for: Initial testing only
```

**Step 2: Keyword Localization**:
```
‚ùå Don't: Directly translate keywords
   "weight loss" ‚Üí "p√©rdida de peso" (too literal)

‚úÖ Do: Research local search terms
   Check app store suggestions in target language
   Analyze local competitors
   Consider cultural differences in terminology

Example:
  US: "workout planner"
  UK: "exercise planner" or "training planner"
  Australia: "fitness programme"
```

**Step 3: Cultural Adaptation**:
```
Consider:
‚Ä¢ Color meanings (red = luck in China, danger in US)
‚Ä¢ Image appropriateness (body types, clothing, gestures)
‚Ä¢ Measurement systems (metric vs imperial)
‚Ä¢ Date/time formats
‚Ä¢ Currency display
‚Ä¢ Legal requirements (age ratings, privacy)
```

**Step 4: Testing**:
```
‚Ä¢ Native speaker review for naturalness
‚Ä¢ A/B test localized vs English in market
‚Ä¢ Monitor conversion rates by locale
‚Ä¢ Gather feedback from local users
‚Ä¢ Iterate based on performance
```

## Category Selection Strategy

### Primary Category

**Visibility Impact**:
- Category top charts (more discoverable)
- Browse impressions
- "You Might Also Like" recommendations
- Category-specific features

**Selection Criteria**:
```
‚úÖ Choose most relevant primary category
‚úÖ Check competitor categories
‚úÖ Consider category competition level
‚úÖ Match user expectations

‚ùå Don't choose less competitive category if irrelevant
‚ùå Don't switch categories frequently
‚ùå Don't choose category that might get rejected
```

**Category Competition Analysis**:
```markdown
| Category | Top App Downloads | Avg Rating | Your Strength |
|----------|-------------------|------------|---------------|
| Health & Fitness | 10M+ | 4.6 | Medium |
| Food & Drink | 5M+ | 4.4 | High |
| Lifestyle | 2M+ | 4.3 | Medium |

Decision: Food & Drink (less competitive, still relevant)
```

### Secondary Category (iOS only)

**Strategy**:
- ‚úÖ Choose to capture additional audience
- ‚úÖ Can be less directly relevant
- ‚úÖ Test different secondary categories

**Example**:
```
Meal planning app:
  Primary: Food & Drink
  Secondary: Health & Fitness (captures diet/fitness audience)

Meditation app:
  Primary: Health & Fitness
  Secondary: Lifestyle (captures stress management audience)
```
