    cat ~/.claude/skills/customer-success/SKILL.md
elif [ -f .claude/skills/customer-success/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat .claude/skills/customer-success/SKILL.md
elif [ -f plugins/customer-success/skills/customer-success/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat plugins/customer-success/skills/customer-success/SKILL.md
