## Health Score Framework

### Multi-Dimensional Health Model

**Usage Health (30%)**:
- Daily/weekly active users
- Login frequency
- Feature adoption breadth
- Session duration and depth
- Core workflow completion

**Calculation Example**:
```
Usage Score = (
  (Active Users / Total Licensed Users) * 40% +
  (Features Used / Total Features) * 30% +
  (Logins per Week / Expected Logins) * 30%
) * 30
```

**Engagement Health (25%)**:
- Response to emails/calls
- Meeting attendance
- QBR participation
- Proactive communication
- Executive engagement

**Calculation Example**:
```
Engagement Score = (
  Email Response Rate * 30% +
  Meeting Attendance Rate * 25% +
  QBR Participation (1 or 0) * 25% +
  Days Since Last Contact (weighted) * 20%
) * 25
```

**Support Health (20%)**:
- Ticket volume (lower is better)
- Ticket severity
- Resolution time
- Support satisfaction
- Escalation rate

**Calculation Example**:
```
Support Score = (
  (1 - Ticket Volume / Baseline) * 30% +
  (1 - Critical Tickets / Total Tickets) * 30% +
  (Support CSAT / 5) * 40%
) * 20
```

**Satisfaction Health (15%)**:
- NPS score
- CSAT ratings
- Product feedback
- Feature requests
- Reference/review willingness

**Calculation Example**:
```
Satisfaction Score = (
  (NPS + 100) / 200 * 50% +
  (CSAT / 5) * 30% +
  Sentiment Score * 20%
) * 15
```

**Financial Health (10%)**:
- Payment status
- Contract value
- Expansion revenue
- Budget confirmed for renewal
- Multi-year commitment

**Calculation Example**:
```
Financial Score = (
  Payment Current (1 or 0.5 or 0) * 40% +
  Expansion Revenue (weighted) * 30% +
  Renewal Budget Confirmed (1 or 0) * 30%
) * 10
```

### Health Score Thresholds

- üü¢ **Healthy (80-100)**: Low churn risk, expansion opportunity
- üü° **At Risk (50-79)**: Moderate risk, intervention needed
- üî¥ **Critical (0-49)**: High churn risk, urgent action required

### Health Monitoring Cadence

- **Healthy accounts**: Monthly review
- **At-risk accounts**: Bi-weekly review
- **Critical accounts**: Weekly review
- **All accounts**: Automated daily monitoring with alerts
