## Keyword Research

### Keyword Research Methodology

**Step 1: Identify Seed Keywords**
- Core topics related to your content
- Industry terminology
- Product/service names
- Problem statements your audience has

**Step 2: Expand with Tools** (mentioned for context)
- Google Autocomplete
- "People also ask" boxes
- Related searches at bottom of SERP
- Competitor content analysis

**Step 3: Analyze Metrics**
- **Search Volume**: Monthly searches for keyword
- **Keyword Difficulty**: Competition level (0-100)
- **Search Intent**: Why users search this term
- **Trend**: Growing, declining, or stable

**Step 4: Prioritize Keywords**

**Formula**: Priority = (Search Volume × Relevance) / Difficulty

Focus on:
- High relevance to your content
- Reasonable search volume (100+ monthly)
- Low to medium difficulty
- Match your domain authority level

### Keyword Types

**Short-Tail Keywords** (1-2 words):
- High search volume
- Very competitive
- Broad intent
- Example: "SEO optimization"

**Long-Tail Keywords** (3+ words):
- Lower search volume
- Less competitive
- Specific intent
- Higher conversion rate
- Example: "SEO optimization for small business blogs"

**LSI Keywords** (Latent Semantic Indexing):
- Related terms and synonyms
- Context and topic relevance
- Natural language variations
- Example: For "content marketing" → "content strategy", "blog posts", "audience engagement"

### Keyword Placement Strategy

**Critical Locations** (must include primary keyword):
1. **Title Tag** (H1): First 60 characters
2. **Meta Description**: Within 150-160 characters
3. **URL Slug**: Primary keyword
4. **First Paragraph**: Within first 100 words
5. **H2 Headings**: 2-3 headings
6. **Image Alt Text**: 1-2 images
7. **Throughout Content**: Natural distribution

**Keyword Density Guidelines**:
- **Primary Keyword**: 1-2% of total content
- **Secondary Keywords**: 0.5-1% each
- **Natural Integration**: Prioritize readability over density
- **Avoid Keyword Stuffing**: More than 3% triggers penalties

**Formula**: Keyword Density = (Keyword Count / Total Words) × 100

**Example**: 1,000-word article
- Primary keyword: 10-20 times (1-2%)
- 2-3 Secondary keywords: 5-10 times each (0.5-1%)

## On-Page SEO Elements

### Title Tag Optimization

**Purpose**: Most important on-page SEO factor

**Best Practices**:
- **Length**: 50-60 characters (512 pixels)
- **Keyword Placement**: Include primary keyword early
- **Compelling**: Entice clicks, not just rank
- **Unique**: Different for every page
- **Brand**: Add brand name at end (if space)

**Formula**:
"[Primary Keyword] | [Benefit/Modifier] | [Brand]"

**Examples**:
- ✅ "SEO Optimization Guide for Beginners | 2025 Update"
- ✅ "How to Optimize Content for Search Engines: Complete Guide"
- ❌ "Welcome to Our Website | Home Page" (too generic)
- ❌ "SEO, Search Engine Optimization, SEM, Digital Marketing..." (keyword stuffing)

**Title Tag Testing**:
- Search "site:yourdomain.com" to see how titles appear
- Use SERP preview tools
- A/B test variations when possible

### Meta Description Optimization

**Purpose**: Influences click-through rate (CTR), not direct ranking factor

**Best Practices**:
- **Length**: 150-160 characters (optimal)
- **Include Keyword**: Primary keyword naturally
- **Value Proposition**: What will they learn/get?
- **Call-to-Action**: Encourage click
- **Unique**: Different for every page

**Formula**:
"[Action verb] [benefit] with our [solution/guide]. [Additional benefit]. [CTA]."

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Learn SEO optimization strategies that drive traffic. Our comprehensive guide covers keyword research, on-page SEO, and link building. Start ranking higher today."
- ✅ "Discover how to optimize your blog posts for search engines. Step-by-step framework with real examples. Boost your organic traffic now."
- ❌ "This is an article about SEO and optimization." (boring, no value)

### Header Tag Hierarchy

**Purpose**: Content structure for users and search engines

**H1 Tag** (Main Heading):
- **One per page** (critical rule)
- Matches or closely aligns with title tag
- Includes primary keyword
- Clearly states page topic

**H2 Tags** (Major Sections):
- Main topic divisions
- Include keywords in 2-3 H2s
- Descriptive and specific
- Logical content flow

**H3 Tags** (Subsections):
- Support H2 topics
- Add depth without overwhelming
- Can include long-tail keywords
- Further organize content

**H4-H6 Tags** (Rare Usage):
- Deep subsections only
- Most content doesn't need beyond H3
- Don't skip levels (H2 → H4)

**Example Structure**:
```
H1: SEO Optimization Guide for Beginners
  H2: What is SEO Optimization?
    H3: On-Page SEO
    H3: Off-Page SEO
  H2: Keyword Research Best Practices
    H3: Finding Keywords
    H3: Analyzing Competition
  H2: How to Optimize Your Content
    H3: Title Tags and Meta Descriptions
    H3: Content Structure
```

### URL Structure

**Purpose**: User-friendly and search engine-friendly URLs

**Best Practices**:
- **Short and Descriptive**: 3-5 words ideal
- **Include Keyword**: Primary keyword
- **Use Hyphens**: Word separators (not underscores)
- **Lowercase**: All lowercase letters
- **Avoid Stop Words**: Remove "a", "the", "of", "and" when possible
- **Readable**: Human-friendly, not ID numbers

**Examples**:
- ✅ `/blog/seo-optimization-guide`
- ✅ `/content-marketing-strategies-2025`
- ❌ `/blog/p=12345` (non-descriptive)
- ❌ `/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-search-engine-optimization-for-beginners-in-2025` (too long)
- ❌ `/blog/seo_optimization_guide` (underscores)
