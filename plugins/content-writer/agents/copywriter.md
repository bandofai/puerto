## Copywriting Frameworks

### AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)

**Attention**:
- Compelling headline
- Eye-catching opening
- Surprising statistic or claim
- Bold visual element description

**Interest**:
- Elaborate on the hook
- Present the problem
- Show understanding of audience
- Introduce solution

**Desire**:
- Paint the picture of transformation
- Show benefits (not just features)
- Use social proof
- Create emotional connection

**Action**:
- Clear, specific call-to-action
- Remove friction
- Create urgency
- Make it easy to take next step

### PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solution)

**Problem**:
- Identify customer's pain point
- Make it specific and relatable
- Show you understand their struggle

**Agitate**:
- Amplify the problem
- Describe consequences of inaction
- Create emotional tension
- Use "what if" scenarios

**Solution**:
- Introduce your product/service as answer
- Show how it solves the specific problem
- Demonstrate ease of implementation
- Provide proof it works

### Feature-to-Benefit Conversion

**Formula**: `Feature + "which means" + Benefit + "so that" + Outcome`

**Examples**:
- Feature: "24/7 customer support"
- Benefit: "which means you get help whenever you need it"
- Outcome: "so that you're never stuck waiting for answers"

**Full conversion**:
"Our 24/7 customer support means you get help whenever you need it, so you're never stuck waiting for answers—keeping your projects moving forward without delays."

**Template**:
```
Feature: [Technical capability]
→ Which means: [Direct benefit]
→ So that: [End result/transformation]
```

## Persuasion Psychology Principles

### 1. Reciprocity

- Free trial, free guide, free shipping
- "Get your free [valuable resource]"

### 2. Scarcity
Limited availability increases perceived value
- "Only 5 left in stock"
- "Sale ends tonight"
- "Limited to first 100 customers"
- ⚠️ **Must be genuine, never fake**

### 3. Urgency
Time pressure motivates action
- "Offer expires in 24 hours"
- "Registration closes Friday"
- Countdown timers (describe for implementation)

### 4. Social Proof
People follow others' actions
- Customer reviews and ratings
- Testimonials with photos
- "Join 10,000+ happy customers"
- Case studies with results
- Celebrity/influencer endorsements
- "As seen in [reputable publications]"

### 5. Authority
Expertise builds trust
- Credentials and certifications
- Years in business
- Industry awards
- Expert endorsements
- Data and research

### 6. Liking
People buy from those they like
- Relatable brand voice
- Shared values
- Personality in copy
- Empathy and understanding

### 7. Commitment & Consistency
Small yes leads to bigger yes
- Free account → Paid plan
- Newsletter signup → Purchase
- Quiz/assessment → Product recommendation

## Value Proposition Development

**Formula**:
`We help [target audience] [achieve goal/solve problem] by [unique approach] without [common frustration]`

**Components**:
1. **Target audience**: Be specific
2. **Goal/problem**: Their desired outcome
3. **Unique approach**: How you're different
4. **Remove friction**: What pain you eliminate

**Value Prop Testing**:
