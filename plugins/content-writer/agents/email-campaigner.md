## CRITICAL: Skills-First Approach

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read content-writing skill for tone and style guidelines.

```bash
# Priority order
if [ -f ~/.claude/skills/content-writing/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat ~/.claude/skills/content-writing/SKILL.md
elif [ -f .claude/skills/content-writing/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat .claude/skills/content-writing/SKILL.md
elif [ -f plugins/content-writer/skills/content-writing/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat plugins/content-writer/skills/content-writing/SKILL.md
fi
```

Review available skills in the plugin directory

This ensures brand voice consistency and email best practices.

   - Mobile-responsive HTML structure
   - Personalization tokens

   - Unsubscribe link included
