## SEO Analysis Framework

### 1. Keyword Analysis

**Target Keyword Evaluation**:
- Search intent match (informational, navigational, transactional, commercial)
- Keyword difficulty vs. domain authority
- Search volume vs. competition ratio
- User intent behind the search

**Keyword Placement Checklist**:
- [ ] Title tag (first 60 chars)
- [ ] Meta description
- [ ] H1 heading (exactly once)
- [ ] First paragraph (first 100 words)
- [ ] At least 2 H2 headings
- [ ] Image alt text
- [ ] URL slug
- [ ] Naturally throughout content

**Keyword Density**:
- Primary keyword: 1-2% of content
- Related keywords: 0.5-1% each
- Avoid keyword stuffing
- Use synonyms and variations

**LSI Keywords** (Latent Semantic Indexing):
- Identify related terms
- Include naturally in content
- Use in subheadings
- Enhance topic comprehension

### 2. On-Page SEO Elements

**Title Tag Optimization**:
- Length: 50-60 characters (avoid truncation)
- Include primary keyword (preferably at start)
- Compelling and click-worthy
- Unique for each page
- Brand name (at end if space allows)

**Meta Description**:
- Length: 150-160 characters
- Include primary keyword
- Clear value proposition
- Call-to-action
- Compelling preview of content

**Header Tag Hierarchy**:
```
H1: Main topic (once per page)
├── H2: Major section
│   ├── H3: Subsection
│   └── H3: Subsection
├── H2: Major section
│   └── H3: Subsection
└── H2: Major section
```

**Rules**:
- One H1 per page (matches title)
- H2s for main sections
- H3s for subsections
- Don't skip levels (H2 → H4)
- Include keywords in 2-3 headings

**URL Structure**:
- Short and descriptive
- Include target keyword
- Use hyphens (not underscores)
- Lowercase only
- Avoid stop words (a, the, of)
- Example: `/blog/seo-optimization-guide`

### 3. Readability Analysis

**Flesch Reading Ease Score**:
- 90-100: Very easy (5th grade)
- 60-70: Standard (8th-9th grade) ← **Target for blogs**
- 30-50: Difficult (college level)
- 0-30: Very difficult (graduate level)

**Formula**: `206.835 - 1.015 × (words/sentences) - 84.6 × (syllables/words)`

**Readability Improvements**:
- Shorten sentences (15-20 words average)
- Use simple words (prefer 1-2 syllables)

### 5. Internal Linking Strategy

**Best Practices**:

- Create topic clusters (pillar + supporting)

**Anchor Text Guidelines**:
- ✅ "SEO optimization guide for beginners"

    ├── [Cluster: "Keyword Research"]

### 8. Search Intent Analysis
