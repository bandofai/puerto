**Skill-aware**: Reads `component-development` skill before starting

**Example usage**:
```bash
"Create a reusable Button component with variants (primary, secondary, danger)
and support for icons, loading state, and full keyboard accessibility"
```

**Output**:
- Component file (`.tsx` / `.vue` / `.svelte`)
- Style file (CSS module or scoped styles)
- Test file with comprehensive coverage
- Usage examples

**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
**Model**: Haiku (fast, cost-effective for template-based work)

---

### 2. style-implementer (Haiku - CSS is Deterministic)

**When to use**: Implementing responsive designs and styling

**What it does**:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- CSS/Tailwind/styled-components/CSS Modules support
- Performance optimization (< 50KB CSS, tree-shaking)
- Dark mode implementation
- Smooth animations (60fps, GPU-accelerated)
- Browser compatibility (autoprefixer)

**Skill-aware**: Reads `responsive-design` skill before starting

**Example usage**:
```bash
"Implement responsive styles for the ProductCard component. Mobile-first approach,
3-column grid on desktop, 2-column on tablet, single column on mobile. Add dark
mode support and smooth hover animations."
```

**Output**:

- **Tier 2**: Operable (keyboard navigation, focus management)
- **Tier 3**: Understandable (labels, error messages, consistency)
- **Tier 4**: Robust (valid HTML, ARIA, assistive tech compatibility)

**Example usage**:
```bash
"Validate the checkout flow for accessibility compliance. Focus on form labels,
error handling, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support."
```

**Output**:
- Comprehensive compliance report
- Issues by severity with file/line numbers
- Code examples for each fix
- Compliance score (% passing)
- Testing recommendations

**Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (analysis only)
**Model**: Sonnet (requires judgment for severity assessment)

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Create New Feature Component

```bash
# 1. Create component
@component-builder "Create a ProductCard component that displays product image,
name, price, rating, and add-to-cart button. Should be responsive and accessible."

# 2. Implement styles
@style-implementer "Implement responsive styles for ProductCard. 3-column grid
on desktop, 2-column on tablet, single column on mobile. Include hover effects
and smooth transitions."

# 3. Validate accessibility
@accessibility-validator "Validate ProductCard for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
Check image alt text, button labels, keyboard navigation, and color contrast."

# 4. If state needed
@state-architect "Implement cart state management to track added products,
quantities, and totals. Use Zustand with localStorage persistence."
```

### Example 2: Refactor Existing Component

```bash
# 1. Validate current state
@accessibility-validator "Audit the current UserProfile component for
accessibility issues."

# 2. Fix issues
@component-builder "Refactor UserProfile component to fix accessibility
issues: add proper ARIA labels, improve keyboard navigation, and enhance
screen reader support."

# 3. Optimize styles
@style-implementer "Optimize UserProfile styles for performance. Reduce CSS
bundle size, improve animation performance, and ensure responsive behavior."
```

### Example 3: Full Page Implementation

```bash
# 1. State architecture
@state-architect "Design state management for checkout page. Need user info,
shipping address, payment method, cart items, and order summary.
Recommend appropriate solution."

# 2. Create components
@component-builder "Create CheckoutForm component with steps:
1) Customer info, 2) Shipping, 3) Payment, 4) Review. Include form validation
and error handling."

# 3. Implement responsive layout
@style-implementer "Implement responsive checkout layout. Two-column on desktop
(form + summary), single column on mobile. Sticky order summary on desktop."

# 4. Validate entire flow
@accessibility-validator "Validate complete checkout flow for accessibility.
Focus on form labels, error messages, keyboard navigation, and screen reader
announcements."
```

```

**Svelte + TypeScript**:
```bash
# Agents auto-detect Svelte from package.json and svelte.config.js
```

---

## Design Decisions

### Why These Agents?

**Four agents, not one**: Single responsibility principle. Each agent is an expert in one area:
- component-builder: Component structure and logic
- style-implementer: Visual design and responsiveness
- accessibility-validator: WCAG compliance (independent audit)
- state-architect: Data flow and state management

**Why accessibility-validator is read-only**: Audit independence. Validators shouldn't be able to modify what they're validating. This ensures unbiased compliance assessment.

**Why different models**:
- Haiku (component-builder, style-implementer): Template-based work, 90% cost savings
- Sonnet (accessibility-validator, state-architect): Requires judgment and analysis

### Why Skill-Aware?

Without skills, agents produce inconsistent results based on general knowledge. With skills, agents follow battle-tested patterns from production deployments:

**Quality Difference**:
- Without skills: ~60% satisfaction, frequent revisions
- With skills: ~95% satisfaction, first-time-right

Skills are continuously updated with lessons learned from production use.

## Cost Optimization

**Estimated costs per task** (based on Claude pricing):

| Task | Agent | Model | Est. Cost |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Create component | component-builder | Haiku | ~$0.02 |
| Implement styles | style-implementer | Haiku | ~$0.01 |
| Validate accessibility | accessibility-validator | Sonnet | ~$0.05 |
| Implement state | state-architect | Sonnet | ~$0.08 |

**Total cost for full feature**: ~$0.16

**Cost savings vs. all-Sonnet**: ~70% (Haiku is 10x cheaper)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't activate automatically

**Issue**: Agent doesn't trigger when expected

**Solutions**:
- Check agent description has trigger phrases (PROACTIVELY, MUST BE USED)
- Invoke manually: `@component-builder "task description"`
- Verify agent file exists and is valid YAML

### Component doesn't match project style

**Issue**: Generated code uses different patterns than existing code

**Solutions**:
- Create project-specific skill: `.claude/skills/component-development/SKILL.md`
- Add examples from your codebase to the skill
- Agent will prioritize project skills over defaults

### Accessibility validator misses issues

**Issue**: Some a11y problems not detected

**Solutions**:
- Run automated tools yourself (axe-core, Lighthouse, Pa11y)
- Remember: Automated tools catch ~30% of issues
- Manual testing with keyboard and screen reader is essential
- User testing with people with disabilities is gold standard

### Performance issues with state

**Issue**: Too many re-renders, slow updates

**Solutions**:
- Use granular subscriptions (select specific state slice)
- Split large stores by domain (user, cart, ui)
- Avoid derived state in store (compute on demand)
- Check for proper memoization (useMemo, useCallback)

---

## Best Practices

### Component Development

1. **Always read skill first**: Agents read skills automatically, don't skip this
2. **Start with types**: Define props interface before implementation
3. **Accessibility by default**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard support
4. **Test thoroughly**: 80%+ coverage, including edge cases
5. **Document usage**: JSDoc comments and usage examples

### Styling

1. **Mobile-first always**: Base styles for mobile, enhance for desktop
2. **Use CSS custom properties**: For theming and maintainability
3. **Performance matters**: < 50KB CSS, remove unused styles
4. **Support preferences**: Dark mode, reduced motion
5. **Test on devices**: Not just browser DevTools

### Accessibility

1. **Validate early**: Run accessibility-validator before considering feature "done"
2. **Fix critical issues immediately**: Color contrast, keyboard navigation, alt text
3. **Test manually**: Keyboard-only navigation, screen reader testing
4. **User testing**: Real users with disabilities provide invaluable feedback

### State Management

1. **Choose wisely**: Use decision tree to pick right solution
2. **Split by domain**: Separate stores for user, cart, ui, etc.
3. **Type everything**: Full TypeScript coverage for state and actions
4. **Test thoroughly**: Pure functions are easy to test
5. **Monitor performance**: Profile with React DevTools, optimize subscriptions
