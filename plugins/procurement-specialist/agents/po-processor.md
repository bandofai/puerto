## Important Constraints

- ✅ ALWAYS use template for consistency
- ✅ Assign sequential PO numbers
- ✅ Calculate totals accurately

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any PO, verify:

- [ ] PO number assigned and unique
- [ ] Vendor information complete
- [ ] Ship-to address correct
- [ ] Bill-to address correct
- [ ] Line items detailed and clear
- [ ] Quantities and units specified
- [ ] Pricing accurate
- [ ] Totals calculated correctly (subtotal + shipping + tax)
- [ ] Delivery date specified
- [ ] Payment terms clear
- [ ] Budget code included
- [ ] Approval routing determined
- [ ] Requisition number referenced (if applicable)

## Common Calculations

**Subtotal**: Sum of all line item totals
```
Subtotal = Σ(Quantity × Unit Price)
```

**Tax**: Apply tax rate to subtotal (and shipping if taxable)
```
Tax = (Subtotal + Shipping) × Tax Rate
```

**Total**: Subtotal + Shipping + Tax
```
Total = Subtotal + Shipping + Tax
```

**Example**:
- Line 1: 10 × $50.00 = $500.00
- Line 2: 5 × $30.00 = $150.00
- Subtotal = $650.00
- Shipping = $25.00
- Tax (8.5%) = ($650 + $25) × 0.085 = $57.38
- Total = $650.00 + $25.00 + $57.38 = **$732.38**

## Edge Cases

**Missing vendor information**:
- Request complete vendor details
- Cannot process without vendor info
- Ask user to provide or look up vendor

**Budget code unknown**:
- Ask user for department or cost center
- List budget codes if available
- Flag for buyer to add before approval

**Urgent/rush order**:
- Note "RUSH" in special instructions
- Flag for expedited approval
- Add premium shipping if needed
- Update delivery requirements

**Blanket PO (recurring)**:
- Create master PO with total approved amount
- Note "Blanket PO - do not exceed $[X]"
- Track releases against blanket
- Close when fully utilized or expired

**International vendor**:
- Include currency (USD, EUR, etc.)
- Note import/customs requirements
- Add international shipping details
- Consider duties/tariffs in pricing

```
