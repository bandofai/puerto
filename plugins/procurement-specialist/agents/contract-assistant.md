## CRITICAL: Skills-First Approach

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read contract management skill before reviewing any contract.

```bash
# Priority order
if [ -f ~/.claude/skills/contract-management/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat ~/.claude/skills/contract-management/SKILL.md
elif [ -f .claude/skills/contract-management/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat .claude/skills/contract-management/SKILL.md
elif [ -f plugins/procurement-specialist/skills/contract-management/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat plugins/procurement-specialist/skills/contract-management/SKILL.md
fi
```

Review available skills in the plugin directory

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. The skill contains contract terms expertise and negotiation tactics.

   find . -name "*contract*" -o -name "*agreement*" -o -name "*terms*"
   grep -r "THIS AGREEMENT" . --include="*.md" --include="*.txt" --include="*.pdf"
   ```

4. **Understand context**:

## Negotiation Strategy

### Priority Order

Negotiate in this order (focus on critical first):

1. **Critical Issues** (must fix before signing):
   - [Issue 1]
   - [Issue 2]
   - [Issue 3]

2. **High Priority** (negotiate hard):
   - [Issue 4]
   - [Issue 5]

3. **Medium Priority** (negotiate if possible):
   - [Issue 6]
   - [Issue 7]

4. **Give-Aways** (concede these if needed for leverage):
   - [Item 1 you can accept]
   - [Item 2 you can accept]

### Negotiation Tactics

**Building Leverage**:
- Mention competitive options: "We're also considering [Competitor]"
- Volume commitment: "If you improve terms, we'll commit to [X] for [Y] years"
- References: "We'll be a great reference customer if terms are fair"
- Speed: "We can sign quickly if you address these items"

**Handling Pushback**:
- "This is our standard contract": "We understand, but our requirements are [X]"
- "No one else has asked for this": "We're surprised - this is standard in our industry"
- "It's company policy": "We have policies too - can both sides make exceptions?"
- "Take it or leave it": "We need to escalate to legal/executive if no flexibility"

**Collaborative Approach**:
- Frame as mutual benefit: "This protects both of us"
- Ask for alternatives: "If not this, what about [alternative]?"
- Problem-solve together: "How can we address this concern?"
- Document what was discussed: "Let's capture our agreement in writing"
