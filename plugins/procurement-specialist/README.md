```

### Example 3: Contract Renewal Evaluation

---

## Design Decisions

### Why These Agents?

**Four agents, not one**: Single responsibility principle. Each agent is an expert in one area:
- vendor-evaluator: Quantitative analysis and comparison
- rfp-manager: Document creation and bid management
- po-processor: Transaction processing and workflow
- contract-assistant: Legal review and risk assessment

**Why different models**:
- Haiku (po-processor): Template-based, deterministic work, 90% cost savings
- Sonnet (others): Requires analysis, judgment, and complex document creation

### Why Skill-Aware?

Without skills, agents produce generic procurement documents. With skills, agents follow your company's specific processes, approval workflows, and risk tolerances:

**Quality Difference**:
- Without skills: ~60% require revisions, miss company requirements
- With skills: ~95% first-time-right, follow company policies

Skills encode your company's procurement best practices and ensure consistency.

## Cost Optimization

**Estimated costs per task** (based on Claude pricing):

| Task | Agent | Model | Est. Cost |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Vendor evaluation | vendor-evaluator | Sonnet | ~$0.10 |
| Create RFP | rfp-manager | Sonnet | ~$0.15 |
| Process PO | po-processor | Haiku | ~$0.02 |
| Review contract | contract-assistant | Sonnet | ~$0.12 |

**Total cost for full procurement cycle**: ~$0.39

**Cost savings vs. all-Sonnet**: ~60% (Haiku for PO processing)

**ROI**: Even a 1-hour time savings per procurement cycle pays for thousands of AI-assisted tasks.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't activate automatically

**Issue**: Agent doesn't trigger when expected

**Solutions**:
- Invoke manually: `@vendor-evaluator "task description"`
- Check agent description in plugin.yaml
- Verify agent file exists and is valid YAML

### Vendor scores seem arbitrary

**Issue**: Evaluation scores don't match expectations

**Solutions**:
- Review scoring criteria in vendor-scorecard template
- Adjust weights to match your priorities (e.g., price 40%, quality 30%)
- Add company-specific criteria to procurement skill
- Provide more context about your requirements

### RFP missing company-specific terms

**Issue**: Generated RFP lacks company policies or standard terms

**Solutions**:
- Create project-specific rfp-process skill: `.claude/skills/rfp-process/SKILL.md`
- Add your standard terms and conditions to the skill
- Include your evaluation criteria and scoring methodology
- Reference existing RFPs as examples in the skill

### Contract review too conservative

**Issue**: Agent flags too many issues as "red flags"

**Solutions**:
- Adjust risk tolerance in contract-management skill
- Specify your company's standard acceptable terms
- Provide industry context (e.g., "standard SaaS contract terms")
- Ask for risk categorization (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

## Best Practices

### Vendor Evaluation

1. **Define criteria upfront**: Know what matters before evaluating
2. **Weight appropriately**: Not everything is equally important
3. **Consider TCO**: Cheapest isn't always most cost-effective
4. **Check references**: Past performance predicts future performance
5. **Assess risk**: Financial stability, geographic concentration, dependencies

### RFP Management

1. **Clear requirements**: Ambiguous requirements get ambiguous proposals
2. **Realistic timelines**: Give vendors enough time to respond properly
3. **Objective scoring**: Define criteria before reviewing proposals
4. **Fair process**: Treat all vendors equally
5. **Document everything**: Audit trail for procurement compliance

### Purchase Orders

1. **Complete information**: All details in PO to avoid disputes
2. **Match requisition**: PO should match approved requisition
3. **Clear payment terms**: Net-30, net-60, payment method
4. **Delivery requirements**: Ship-to address, delivery date, special instructions
5. **Track diligently**: Follow up on delivery and acceptance

### Contract Management

1. **Read everything**: Don't skip the fine print
2. **Negotiate always**: First offer is rarely best offer
3. **Limit liability**: Cap damages, exclude consequential damages
4. **Clear termination**: Know how to exit if things go wrong
5. **Get legal review**: For significant or unusual contracts

## Integration with Other Plugins

### With expense-manager

```bash
# 1. Create purchase order
@po-processor "Create PO for office supplies, $1,500"

# 2. Process invoice when received
@expense-processor "Process invoice INV-12345 against PO-2025-0156,
verify amounts match"
```

### With tax-compliance

```bash
# 1. Review contract for tax implications
@contract-assistant "Review consulting agreement for tax withholding
requirements, employee vs. contractor classification, international
tax considerations"

# 2. Track procurement for tax reporting
@tax-tracker "Log equipment purchases from POs in Q4 2024 for
tax depreciation schedules"
```

## Contract Red Flags

**Liability Issues**:

**Commercial Risks**:
- Auto-renewal without notice period
- Price escalation without caps
- Minimum commitments without flexibility
- Early termination penalties

**IP and Data**:
- Vendor claims ownership of your data
- Broad license grants to vendor
- Unclear data return/deletion obligations
- IP warranty disclaimers

**Operational Concerns**:
- Weak SLAs or no SLA penalties
- Limited termination rights
- Long notice periods for termination
- Assignment rights (vendor can transfer without consent)
