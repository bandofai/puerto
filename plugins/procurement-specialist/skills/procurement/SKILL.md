## Vendor Evaluation Framework

### Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis

Use weighted scoring across multiple dimensions:

**Quality & Reliability (30%)**:
- Product/service quality consistently meets specifications
- Low defect rates (< 1% for goods, < 5% for services)
- Certifications and compliance (ISO 9001, industry-specific)
- Process quality (Six Sigma, TQM)
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Awards and recognition

**Evaluation Questions**:
- What is the vendor's quality assurance process?
- What certifications do they maintain?
- What are their defect/error rates?
- How do they handle quality issues?

**Scoring Guidelines**:
- 5: Best-in-class quality, zero defects, premium certifications
- 4: Excellent quality, < 0.5% defects, good certifications
- 3: Acceptable quality, < 2% defects, basic certifications
- 2: Quality concerns, > 2% defects, minimal certifications
- 1: Poor quality, frequent defects, no certifications

---

**Pricing & Total Cost (25%)**:
- Unit pricing competitiveness vs. market
- Volume discounts and economies of scale
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis
- Payment terms (Net 30, 60, discounts)
- Price stability and escalation clauses
- Hidden costs (shipping, handling, setup, training)

**TCO Components**:
```
TCO = Acquisition Cost + Operating Cost + Maintenance Cost + Disposal Cost

Acquisition = Purchase Price + Shipping + Setup + Training + Integration
Operating = Usage Costs + Consumables + Energy + Labor
Maintenance = Service Contracts + Repairs + Upgrades
Disposal = Decommissioning + Removal + Recycling
```

**Evaluation Questions**:
- What is the all-in cost including hidden fees?

- Are there volume discounts available?
- How often do prices increase?

**Scoring Guidelines**:
- 5: Lowest TCO, excellent terms, volume discounts, stable pricing
- 4: Below-market TCO, good terms, some discounts

## Strategic Sourcing Methodologies

### Sourcing Strategy Selection

Choose the right strategy based on spend, risk, and market:

**Single Source**:
- **When**: Unique capabilities, high switching costs, strategic partnership
- **Pros**: Deep relationship, volume discounts, simplified management
- **Cons**: Supply risk, limited negotiation leverage, dependency
- **Mitigation**: Long-term contract, backup plan, close monitoring

**Dual Source**:
- **When**: Critical supplies, moderate risk, multiple qualified vendors
- **Pros**: Reduced risk, competitive pricing, leverage in negotiations
- **Cons**: Split volume (less discount), more complex management
- **Example**: 70/30 split primary/secondary supplier

**Multi-Source**:
- **When**: Commodity items, low risk, many qualified vendors
- **Pros**: Maximum competition, best pricing, supply security
- **Cons**: Less volume per vendor, more relationships to manage
- **Example**: Office supplies, IT peripherals

**Make vs. Buy Decision Framework**:
```
Make (Insource) when:
- Core competency
- Proprietary/confidential
- Cost-effective at volume
- Quality control critical
- Excess capacity available

Buy (Outsource) when:
- Non-core activity
- Vendor expertise superior
- More cost-effective
- Scalability needed
- Capital constraints
```

### Spend Analysis

Categorize spend to prioritize procurement efforts:

**Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)**:
- 20% of vendors typically account for 80% of spend
- Focus strategic sourcing on high-spend categories
- Automate and simplify low-spend categories

**Spend Categories**:

1. **Strategic**: High value, high risk
   - Approach: Strategic partnerships, long-term contracts, joint planning
   - Example: Critical manufacturing components, enterprise software

2. **Leverage**: High value, low risk
   - Approach: Competitive bidding, volume consolidation, price negotiation
   - Example: Office supplies, standard IT hardware

3. **Bottleneck**: Low value, high risk
   - Approach: Secure supply, build relationships, reduce dependency
   - Example: Specialized parts, single-source items

4. **Routine**: Low value, low risk
   - Approach: Simplify process, automate, use catalogs/cards
   - Example: Office supplies, maintenance supplies

   - Cyber security vulnerabilities
   - Obsolete technology
   - **Mitigation**: Security assessments, integration testing, roadmap review

**Risk Matrix**:
```
        Low Impact   High Impact
High    MONITOR      CRITICAL
Prob.   (Accept)     (Mitigate)

Low     IGNORE       MANAGE
Prob.   (Accept)     (Monitor)
```

### Business Continuity Planning

For critical vendors, have contingency plans:

**Contingency Plan Elements**:
1. **Alternative Suppliers**: Pre-qualified backup vendors
2. **Safety Stock**: Inventory buffer for critical items
3. **Substitute Products**: Acceptable alternatives
4. **Emergency Contacts**: Escalation paths for urgent issues
5. **Communication Plan**: How to activate contingency
