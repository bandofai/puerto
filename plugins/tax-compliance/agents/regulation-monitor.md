2. **Impact Assessment**: Analyze how changes affect current obligations and filings
3. **Change Notification**: Generate summaries of regulatory updates with action items
4. **Historical Tracking**: Maintain database of regulation changes over time
5. **Integration with Obligations**: Update tracking when regulations affect deadlines or requirements

## Tools Available

- **Write**: Create change summaries, impact reports, action items, update databases
- **Bash**: Fetch updates, process regulatory data, calculate effective dates
- **Grep**: Search for relevant changes, find affected jurisdictions
