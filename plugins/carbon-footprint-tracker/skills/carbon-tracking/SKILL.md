    """
    Calculate carbon emissions for an activity

    Args:
        activity_type: Type of activity (e.g., 'car_gasoline', 'beef', 'electricity')
        amount: Quantity of activity
        unit: Unit of measurement (miles, kg, kWh, etc.)
        metadata: Optional dict with additional context (location, efficiency, etc.)

    Returns:

## Part 5: Offset Recommendations

### Offset Quality Criteria

**Look for**:
- Third-party verification (Gold Standard, VCS, CAR)
- Additionality (wouldn't happen without offset funding)
- Permanence (carbon stays sequestered long-term)
- Co-benefits (biodiversity, local community support)

### Offset Project Types

**1. Renewable Energy Projects**
- Wind farms, solar installations in developing countries
- Cost: $10-20/ton CO2

- Cost: $5-15/ton CO2
- Quality: Medium (permanence risk from fires)
- Impact timeline: 10-30 years for full sequestration

**3. Direct Air Capture**
- Technology that removes CO2 from atmosphere
- Cost: $100-600/ton CO2
- Quality: Highest permanence
- Impact timeline: Immediate and permanent

**4. Cookstove Projects**
- Efficient cookstoves in developing countries
- Cost: $5-10/ton CO2
- Quality: High co-benefits (health, poverty reduction)
- Impact timeline: Immediate

### Recommended Offset Amounts

**For Average American** (16,000 kg/year):
- After reductions to 6,000 kg/year: Offset ~6,000 kg
- Cost at $15/ton: $90/year
- Remaining 6,000 kg: Continue reducing over time

**For Climate Champion** (2,000 kg/year):
- Offset remaining 2,000 kg
- Cost at $15/ton: $30/year
- Approaching net-zero!

## Part 6: Data Quality & Validation

### Logging Best Practices

**1. Consistency**
- Log daily or weekly (not monthly)
- Capture all categories
- Don't cherry-pick (log high-emission activities too)

**2. Accuracy**
- Use actual data when possible (odometer, utility bills)
- Estimate portion sizes for food (kitchen scale helps)
- Round to reasonable precision (no false precision)

**3. Completeness**
- Include all four categories
- Track irregular events (flights, major purchases)
- Note seasonal variations

### Common Estimation Errors

**Underestimation**:
- Forgetting indirect emissions (online shopping shipping)
- Omitting categories (goods purchases)
- Not tracking small frequent activities (coffee shop trips)

**Overestimation**:
- Double-counting (electricity already includes appliances)
- Using worst-case emission factors
- Not accounting for shared emissions (carpooling)

### Data Validation Checks

```python
def validate_entry(entry):
    """Validate emissions log entry for data quality"""

    issues = []

    # Reasonableness checks
    if entry['category'] == 'transport':
        if entry['carbon_kg'] > 100:  # ~500 miles driving in one day
            issues.append("Very high daily transport emissions - verify accuracy")

    if entry['category'] == 'energy':
        if entry['carbon_kg'] > 50:  # ~120 kWh in one day
            issues.append("Very high daily energy use - check if monthly data entered as daily")

    if entry['category'] == 'food':
        if entry['carbon_kg'] > 20:  # Multiple beef meals
            issues.append("High food emissions for one day - verify portions")

    # Required fields
    required = ['date', 'category', 'activity', 'amount', 'carbon_kg']
    for field in required:
        if field not in entry:
            issues.append(f"Missing required field: {field}")

    # Valid categories
    if entry['category'] not in ['transport', 'energy', 'food', 'goods']:
        issues.append(f"Invalid category: {entry['category']}")

    return issues
```

## Part 7: Behavioral Psychology for Reduction

### Motivation Strategies

**1. Make Progress Visible**
- Track daily/weekly totals
- Show cumulative savings
- Visualize equivalents (trees, miles, etc.)

**2. Celebrate Wins**
- Acknowledge any reduction
- Compare to previous periods
- Share achievements

**3. Start Small**
- Pick 1-2 easy changes first
- Build momentum with quick wins
- Add more changes gradually

**4. Focus on Co-Benefits**
- Health (biking, plant-based diet)
- Money savings (energy efficiency, less shopping)
- Quality of life (less commuting, decluttering)

### Common Barriers & Solutions

**Barrier**: "Too expensive"
**Solution**: Focus on free/money-saving changes first (meatless meals, line-dry clothes, bike for short trips)

**Barrier**: "Too inconvenient"
**Solution**: Start with easiest changes, make low-carbon option the default

**Barrier**: "Won't make a difference"
**Solution**: Show cumulative impact, connect to larger movement

**Barrier**: "Don't know where to start"
**Solution**: Use footprint analyzer to identify biggest categories, start there

### Habit Formation Tips

**1. Stack with Existing Habits**
- "When I make coffee, I'll choose plant milk"
- "When I drive, I'll combine errands to reduce trips"

**2. Make It Easy**
- Keep reusable bags in car
- Set smart thermostat once
- Meal prep on Sundays

**3. Track Publicly**
- Share progress with friends
- Join online community
- Accountability partner
