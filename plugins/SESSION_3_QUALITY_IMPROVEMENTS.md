2. **Skill Invocation Guidance** (~355 agents)
   - Current: Some agents have explicit guidance
   - Opportunity: Add to all agents with skills
   - Effort: 4-5 hours
   - Impact: MEDIUM (better developer experience)

3. **Non-YAML Agent Updates** (117 agents)
   - Current: Different format (intentional)
   - Opportunity: Evaluate and convert if needed
   - Effort: 2-3 hours
   - Impact: LOW (different format may be intentional)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
‚úÖ **NONE** - All high-priority quality improvements complete!

### Future Maintenance
1. **New Agents**: Ensure descriptions are 120+ chars with specific details
2. **Grammar Reviews**: Periodic checks for natural flow
