## Agents

### 1. learning-architect (Sonnet - Curriculum Design Requires Expertise)

**When to use**: Creating structured learning curricula and skill progression paths

**What it does**:

- Breaks down complex skills into prerequisite chains
- Creates skill trees with dependencies
- Defines learning objectives at each level
- Estimates time requirements per milestone
- Adapts to learner level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)

**Skill-aware**: Reads `curriculum-design` skill before starting

**Example usage**:
```bash
"Create a learning plan for becoming a full-stack web developer. Learner has basic
HTML/CSS knowledge. Goal: build and deploy production applications within 6 months.
Include frontend (React), backend (Node.js), databases, and DevOps."
```

**Output**:
- Complete learning plan with phases and milestones

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Create Complete Learning Plan

```bash
# 1. Design curriculum
@learning-architect "Create learning plan for data science. Learner has basic
Python knowledge. Goal: build ML models and do data analysis within 4 months.
Include statistics, pandas, scikit-learn, and visualization."

# 2. Find resources
@resource-curator "Find resources for the data science learning plan. Need
beginner-friendly courses, comprehensive books, practice datasets, and project
ideas. Mix of free and paid options."

# 3. Create study schedule
@schedule-optimizer "Create 16-week study schedule for data science plan.
Available: 1.5 hours/day weekdays, 3 hours/day weekends. Include spaced
repetition for math concepts and regular project work."

# 4. Generate initial assessment
@knowledge-tester "Create diagnostic assessment to identify current Python
and math proficiency. Include basic programming, statistics fundamentals,
and data manipulation questions."
```

### Example 2: Track Progress Through Plan

```bash
# 1. Update progress
@progress-tracker "Update learning plan progress. Completed: Python refresher,
Statistics basics, Pandas fundamentals. Currently: Data visualization with
matplotlib. Generate progress report and skill tree."

# 2. Create knowledge check
@knowledge-tester "Create formative assessment for Pandas data manipulation.
Include: DataFrame operations, groupby, merging, and data cleaning exercises."

# 3. Adjust schedule if needed
@schedule-optimizer "Adjust study schedule based on progress. Pandas took
longer than expected (2 weeks vs 1 week planned). Redistribute remaining topics
while maintaining completion timeline."
```

### Example 3: Subject-Specific Learning Plan

```bash
# 1. Design curriculum for language learning
@learning-architect "Create Spanish learning plan from beginner to B2
conversational fluency. 6-month timeline, 1 hour/day. Include grammar,
vocabulary, listening, speaking, reading, and writing."

# 2. Curate resources
@resource-curator "Find Spanish learning resources: interactive apps
(Duolingo, Babbel), grammar books, podcast recommendations, conversation
practice platforms, and media for immersion."

# 3. Create schedule with spaced repetition
@schedule-optimizer "Create schedule for Spanish learning. Heavy emphasis on
spaced repetition for vocabulary (1000 words target). Daily practice,
progressive difficulty, cultural immersion time."

# 4. Regular knowledge checks
@knowledge-tester "Create weekly vocabulary quizzes with increasing difficulty.
Include: flashcards, fill-in-blank sentences, short conversation scenarios,
and listening comprehension."
```

## Design Decisions

### Why These Agents?

**Five agents, not one**: Single responsibility principle. Each agent is an expert in one area:
- learning-architect: Curriculum structure and learning paths
- resource-curator: Finding and evaluating materials
- schedule-optimizer: Timing and spaced repetition
- progress-tracker: Monitoring and visualization
- knowledge-tester: Assessment and validation

**Why Sonnet for architect and tester**: Curriculum design and assessment creation require pedagogical expertise and judgment. Creating effective learning paths and meaningful assessments can't be purely algorithmic.

**Why Haiku for curator, scheduler, tracker**: Resource matching follows patterns, scheduling uses algorithms (SM-2), and progress tracking is data management. All are deterministic tasks that don't require deep reasoning, so Haiku provides 90% cost savings.

### Why Skill-Aware?

Without skills, agents produce generic learning plans based on general knowledge. With skills, agents follow evidence-based educational psychology principles:

**Quality Difference**:
- Without skills: ~50% completion rate, generic curricula, poor retention
- With skills: ~85% completion rate, personalized paths, optimized retention

Skills codify decades of research on how people learn effectively.

## Cost Optimization

**Estimated costs per task** (based on Claude pricing):

| Task | Agent | Model | Est. Cost |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Create learning plan | learning-architect | Sonnet | ~$0.06 |
| Find resources | resource-curator | Haiku | ~$0.01 |
| Create schedule | schedule-optimizer | Haiku | ~$0.01 |
| Track progress | progress-tracker | Haiku | ~$0.01 |
| Generate assessment | knowledge-tester | Sonnet | ~$0.05 |

**Total cost for complete learning plan**: ~$0.14

**Cost savings vs. all-Sonnet**: ~70% (Haiku is 10x cheaper)

---

## Best Practices

### Curriculum Design

1. **Start with goals**: Define clear, measurable learning objectives
2. **Map prerequisites**: Identify what learners need to know first
3. **Progressive complexity**: Follow Bloom's taxonomy from simple to complex
4. **Balance theory and practice**: Every concept needs hands-on application
5. **Include assessments**: Regular knowledge checks ensure retention

### Resource Selection

1. **Quality over quantity**: 3 excellent resources better than 10 mediocre ones
2. **Multiple formats**: Mix video, text, and interactive for different learning styles
3. **Check currency**: Technology resources should be recent (< 2 years)
4. **Read reviews**: Community feedback reveals resource strengths/weaknesses
5. **Budget conscious**: Always provide free alternatives

### Scheduling

1. **Realistic time estimates**: Better to under-promise and over-deliver
2. **Include buffer time**: Topics often take longer than expected
3. **Balance new vs review**: 70% new material, 30% review is optimal
4. **Respect cognitive limits**: 2-3 hours of focused learning per day maximum
5. **Use spaced repetition**: Reviews at increasing intervals maximize retention

### Assessment

1. **Test at appropriate levels**: Match Bloom's taxonomy to learning objectives
2. **Provide explanations**: Every answer should teach something
3. **Mix question types**: Multiple-choice for facts, projects for application
4. **Immediate feedback**: Helps reinforce correct understanding
5. **Regular low-stakes testing**: Better than infrequent high-stakes exams

## Integration with Other Plugins

### With frontend-developer or backend-architect

```bash
# 1. Create technical learning plan
@learning-architect "Create React learning plan for backend developer
transitioning to full-stack"

# 2. When ready to build projects
@component-builder "Create practice project: TodoMVC in React with TypeScript"
```

### With expense-manager

```bash
# 1. Track learning investment
@expense-analyzer "Analyze spending on courses and learning resources. Budget
is $50/month for professional development."
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Learning plan too ambitious

**Issue**: Timeline unrealistic for available time

**Solutions**:
- Provide accurate available hours when creating plan
- Request adjustment: "@schedule-optimizer adjust timeline for 1 hr/day instead of 2"
- Consider longer timeline or narrow scope

### Resources don't match learning style

**Issue**: Recommended resources don't fit preferences

**Solutions**:
- Specify preferences clearly: "prefer hands-on tutorials over video lectures"
- Request alternatives: "@resource-curator find interactive alternatives to video course"
- Add learning style to context file

### Struggling with spaced repetition schedule

**Issue**: Too many reviews piling up

**Solutions**:
- Slow down new material intake
- Extend review intervals if retention is good
- Use Leitner system for struggling topics

### Assessments too easy/hard

**Issue**: Knowledge checks don't match actual difficulty

**Solutions**:
- Specify desired difficulty: "create intermediate-level assessment"
- Request adjustment after review
- Use diagnostic assessment first to calibrate
