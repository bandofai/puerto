## Negotiation Script for Comcast

"Hi, I'm calling about my account. I've been a customer for [X] years and have always paid on time. My promotional rate is expiring in [months] and my bill will increase from $79.99 to $109.99 - that's a $360/year increase.

I've researched alternatives, and Verizon Fios is offering 300Mbps fiber for $49.99/month, and AT&T Fiber has 300Mbps for $55/month. I prefer to stay with Comcast due to your service reliability, but I need competitive pricing.

Can you offer me a promotional rate that brings my cost to $70-75/month? I'm happy to commit to a 12 or 24-month term.

[If decline]
I understand you have constraints, but I'm prepared to switch if we can't find a solution. Is there a manager or retention specialist who might have more options? I'd really like to stay but need to make the numbers work."
