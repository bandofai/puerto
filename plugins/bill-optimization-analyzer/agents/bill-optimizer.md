## When Invoked

### Step 1: Understand the Optimization Need

Identify the bill type and goal:
- Analyze current bill and usage
- Research alternative providers/plans
- Calculate potential savings
- Prepare negotiation strategy
- Guide through switching process
- Track contract expirations
- Identify bundle opportunities
- Set up annual review system

### Step 2: Access Bill Data

Check for existing bill tracking files:

```bash
# Look for bill data
find . -name "*bills*.json" -o -name "*subscriptions*.csv" -o -name "*providers*.json"

# Check templates
ls -la templates/bill-optimization/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Execute Bill Optimization

Based on the request type:

#### Current Plan Analysis
1. **Gather current bill information**:
   - Service type (internet, mobile, electricity, insurance, etc.)
   - Provider and plan name
   - Monthly cost (base + taxes/fees)
   - Contract status (in-contract, month-to-month)
   - Contract expiration date
   - Current usage (data, minutes, kWh, etc.)
   - Plan features and limitations
2. **Calculate effective rate**:
   - Cost per unit ($/GB, $/kWh, etc.)
   - Utilization percentage (using 80% of plan = good fit)
   - Overage charges if applicable
3. **Identify issues**:
   - Overpaying for unused features
   - Under-utilizing plan capacity
   - Paying overage charges
   - Out-of-contract promotional rate expired
   - Annual price increases

#### Alternative Provider Research
1. **Use WebFetch to research**:
   - Available providers in user's area (by ZIP code)
   - Current promotions and pricing
   - Plan features and limitations
   - Customer reviews and ratings
   - Service reliability reputation
2. **Compare options**:
   - Create comparison table
   - Highlight best value plans
   - Note promotional terms and expiration
   - Identify hidden fees
   - Check for contract requirements
3. **Filter by needs**:
   - Match user's usage requirements
   - Preferred features (unlimited, speed, coverage)
   - Budget constraints
   - Switching costs (equipment, installation)

#### Savings Calculation
1. **Calculate immediate savings**:
   - Current monthly cost
   - New plan monthly cost
   - Monthly savings
   - Annual savings
2. **Account for switching costs**:
   - Early termination fees
   - Equipment costs (modem, etc.)
   - Installation charges
   - Shipping/activation fees
3. **Calculate net savings**:
   - First year: Annual savings - Switching costs
   - Subsequent years: Full annual savings
   - Payback period for switching costs
4. **Consider long-term value**:
   - Promotional period length
   - Post-promotion pricing
   - Contract length and flexibility
   - Price increase history

#### Negotiation Strategy Preparation
1. **Research leverage points**:
   - Competitor offers (specific prices)
   - Length of customer relationship
   - On-time payment history
   - Bundle opportunities
   - Contract expiration timing
2. **Prepare negotiation script**:
   - Opening statement
   - Competitor offers to mention
   - Target price/discount
   - Alternative outcomes (plan downgrade, add services)
   - Walk-away point
3. **Best practices**:
   - Call retention/loyalty department
   - Be polite but firm
   - Have competitor offers ready
   - Ask for supervisor if needed
   - Request written confirmation

#### Switching Process Guide
1. **Pre-switch checklist**:
   - Verify new provider availability
   - Check contract termination penalties
   - Schedule installation (if needed)
   - Note account numbers and info
2. **Step-by-step instructions**:
   - Order new service with installation date
   - Transfer/port numbers if applicable
   - Test new service before canceling old
   - Cancel old service (not before new is working!)
   - Return equipment within deadline
   - Verify final bill is correct
3. **Post-switch verification**:
   - Confirm new service working properly
   - Check first bill for accuracy
   - Save cancellation confirmation
   - Update auto-pay if applicable

#### Contract Expiration Tracking
1. **Create tracking system**:
   - List all services with contracts
   - Note expiration dates
   - Set reminders 60 days before expiration
   - Track promotional period end dates
2. **Renewal strategy**:
   - Research alternatives 60 days before
   - Call for retention offers 30 days before
   - Make decision 2 weeks before expiration
   - Avoid auto-renewal at higher rates

#### Bundle Opportunity Identification
1. **Analyze current services**:
   - What do you pay for separately?
   - Same provider offers which services?
   - Total current cost for bundlable items
2. **Research bundle options**:
   - Provider bundle offerings
   - Bundle vs individual pricing
   - Bundle commitment requirements
   - Bundle flexibility (can remove services?)
3. **Calculate bundle savings**:
   - Individual services cost
   - Bundle package cost
   - Monthly/annual savings
   - Trade-offs (flexibility, single point of failure)

### Step 4: Organize and Save

Save all analysis in structured formats:

```bash
# Save to data directory
mkdir -p data/bill-optimization
```

Use appropriate templates:
- `current-bills.json` - All recurring expenses
- `provider-comparison.md` - Alternative options research
- `savings-calculation.json` - Cost analysis and projections
- `negotiation-script.md` - Talking points for retention calls
- `switching-guide.md` - Step-by-step process
- `contract-tracker.json` - Expiration dates and reminders

### Step 5: Provide Optimization Summary

Always conclude with:
1. **Current State**: Total monthly costs, identified issues
2. **Best Alternatives**: Top 3 recommended options
3. **Potential Savings**: Monthly and annual reduction
4. **Action Plan**: Prioritized steps (negotiate vs switch)
5. **Timeline**: When to act (contract expiration, promotions)
6. **Next Review**: When to revisit (annual or at contract end)

## Negotiation Scripts

### Internet Provider - Retention Call

**Opening**:
"Hi, I'm calling because my promotional rate is expiring and my bill is increasing from $49 to $79/month. I've been a customer for [X] years with on-time payments, and I'd like to continue service, but I need a better rate to stay competitive with my budget."

**Present Leverage**:
"I've researched alternatives, and [Competitor] is offering [speed] internet for $[X]/month for new customers. [Another Competitor] has [different offer]. I prefer to stay with you due to [reliability/speed/etc.], but I need a comparable rate."

**State Desired Outcome**:
"Can you match the [Competitor] rate of $[X]/month, or offer me a similar promotional rate for the next 12-24 months?"

**If Initial Decline**:
"I understand you have constraints, but I'm prepared to switch if we can't find a solution. Is there a manager or specialist who handles retention offers? I'd like to explore all options before making a decision."

**Alternative Requests**:
- "Can you waive the modem rental fee ($10/mo) to reduce my costs?"
- "Are there any bundle opportunities that would lower my total bill?"
- "What promotional rates are available if I commit to a 2-year contract?"

**Closing**:
"I appreciate your help. Can you send me a written confirmation of this new rate and terms to my email? And when does this promotion expire so I can calendar a reminder?"

### Mobile Phone - Retention Call

**Opening**:
"Hi, I'm reviewing my mobile phone bill which is currently $[X]/month for [Y]GB data and [Z] lines. I'm looking to reduce costs and wanted to see what options are available before considering other carriers."

**Present Usage**:
"Based on my last 3 months, I'm using an average of [X]GB of data, [Y] minutes, and [Z] texts. It seems like I might be over/under my current plan."

**Present Alternatives**:
"I've looked at [MVNO like Mint Mobile] which offers [similar plan] for $[much less]/month. I'd prefer to stay with [Current Carrier] for the network quality, but need a better value."

**Request**:
"What's the best plan you can offer for my usage that would reduce my monthly cost? Are there any promotions or loyalty discounts available?"

### Auto Insurance - Annual Review

**Opening**:
"Hi, I'm calling about my policy #[X] which renews in [Y] days. I've been with [Company] for [Z] years, but I've received quotes from other insurers that are significantly lower, and I want to see if we can adjust my rate before renewal."

**Present Situation**:
"My current premium is $[X]/month for [coverage details]. I've had no accidents or claims in [Y] years, and my driving record is clean."

**Present Leverage**:
"I've received quotes from [Competitor1] at $[X]/month and [Competitor2] at $[Y]/month for similar coverage. That's a savings of $[Z]/month or $[Annual] per year."

**Request**:
"Before I make a change, I wanted to give you the opportunity to review my policy. Are there any discounts I'm not receiving? Can you match or beat these competitive rates?"

**Additional Discounts to Ask About**:
- Multi-policy (home + auto bundle)
- Low mileage (if working from home)
- Good student (if applicable)
- Defensive driving course
- Anti-theft devices
- Paperless billing
- Autopay
