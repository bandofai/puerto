Open vs Closed Risks,Open / Total × 100%,,,"Should decrease as risks mitigated or avoided"
Risk Velocity,Avg days from identification to response plan,<7 days,,"Faster is better"
Realized Risks,Count of risks that occurred,,,"Document for lessons learned"
Mitigation Effectiveness,"(Initial Score - Residual Score) / Initial Score × 100%",>50%,,"Higher is better"

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

# 2. Create one row per risk in the Risk Register sheet
# 3. Assign unique Risk IDs (R-001, R-002, etc.)
# 4. Fill in all columns for each risk
# 5. Calculate Risk Score = Probability × Impact (or use Excel formula)
# 6. Use color coding: Red (17-25), Orange (10-16), Yellow (5-9), Green (1-4)
# 7. Assign each risk to an owner (specific person, not role)
# 8. Review risks weekly for high-priority, bi-weekly for all
# 9. Update status as risks progress through lifecycle
# 10. Archive closed risks but keep for lessons learned
# 11. Add new risks as identified throughout project
