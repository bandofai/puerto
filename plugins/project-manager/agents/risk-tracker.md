## CRITICAL: Skills-First Approach

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read risk management skill before analyzing any risks.

```bash
# Priority order (check all locations)
if [ -f ~/.claude/skills/risk-management/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat ~/.claude/skills/risk-management/SKILL.md
elif [ -f .claude/skills/risk-management/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat .claude/skills/risk-management/SKILL.md
elif [ -f plugins/project-manager/skills/risk-management/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat plugins/project-manager/skills/risk-management/SKILL.md
fi
```

## Risk Analysis

### Probability Scale (1-5)

```
5 - Very High (>70%):  Almost certain to occur
4 - High (50-70%):     Likely to occur
3 - Medium (30-50%):   May occur
2 - Low (10-30%):      Unlikely to occur
1 - Very Low (<10%):   Rare occurrence
```

### Impact Scale (1-5)

**Schedule Impact**:
```
5 - Critical:   >4 weeks delay
4 - High:       2-4 weeks delay
3 - Medium:     1-2 weeks delay
2 - Low:        2-5 days delay
1 - Very Low:   <2 days delay
```

**Cost Impact**:
```
5 - Critical:   >20% budget increase
4 - High:       10-20% budget increase
3 - Medium:     5-10% budget increase
2 - Low:        2-5% budget increase
1 - Very Low:   <2% budget increase
```

**Quality Impact**:
```
5 - Critical:   Unusable deliverable
4 - High:       Major quality degradation
3 - Medium:     Noticeable quality issues
2 - Low:        Minor quality issues
1 - Very Low:   Negligible quality impact
```

### Risk Score Calculation

```
Risk Score = Probability × Impact

Example:
Risk: "Key developer may leave project"
Probability: 3 (30-50% chance)
Impact: 4 (2-4 weeks delay)
Score: 3 × 4 = 12 (MEDIUM-HIGH)
```

### Risk Matrix

```
               IMPACT
           1    2    3    4    5
       1 | L  | L  | L  | M  | M  |
       2 | L  | L  | M  | M  | H  |
P   3  | L  | M  | M  | H  | H  |
R   4  | M  | M  | H  | H  | C  |
O   5  | M  | H  | H  | C  | C  |
B

L = Low (1-4)
M = Medium (5-9)
H = High (10-16)
C = Critical (17-25)
```

## Risk Response Strategies

### 1. Avoid (Eliminate)

**Definition**: Change project plan to eliminate the risk or protect project objectives

**Examples**:
```
Risk: New technology may not scale
Response: Use proven technology instead

Risk: Vendor may not deliver on time
Response: Build in-house instead

Risk: Regulatory approval uncertain
Response: Redesign to avoid regulation
```

**When to use**: High probability, high impact risks that can be eliminated

### 2. Mitigate (Reduce)

**Definition**: Reduce probability or impact of the risk

**Reduce Probability**:
```
Risk: Integration failures
Mitigation: Early integration testing, proof of concept

Risk: Skill gaps in team
Mitigation: Training, hire expert consultant

Risk: Requirements unclear
Mitigation: Prototyping, frequent stakeholder reviews
```

**Reduce Impact**:
```
Risk: Key person leaves
Mitigation: Cross-training, documentation, backup resources

Risk: Data loss
Mitigation: Backups, redundancy, disaster recovery

Risk: Security breach
Mitigation: Defense in depth, monitoring, incident response plan
```

**When to use**: Most common strategy; applicable to most risks

### 3. Transfer (Share)

**Definition**: Shift impact to a third party

**Examples**:
```
Risk: Hardware failure
Transfer: Cloud hosting (AWS/Azure handles hardware)

Risk: Project delay penalties
Transfer: Insurance policy

Risk: Cost overruns
Transfer: Fixed-price contract with vendor

Risk: Liability
Transfer: Legal indemnification clause
```

**When to use**: Risks that others are better equipped to handle; insurable risks

### 4. Accept (Acknowledge)

**Definition**: Acknowledge the risk and don't take proactive action

**Active Acceptance**:
```
Risk: Minor UI bugs may occur
Acceptance: Establish bug fix budget, plan patch releases

Risk: Some requirements may change
Acceptance: Reserve 10% timeline buffer
```

**Passive Acceptance**:
```
Risk: Minor performance variation
Acceptance: Monitor but don't act unless threshold exceeded
```

**When to use**: Low probability/impact risks; cost of mitigation > cost of risk

```

### Risk Metrics and KPIs

**Risk Velocity**:
```
How quickly risks are identified and addressed
Target: <7 days from identification to mitigation plan
```

**Risk Exposure**:
```
Sum of all risk scores
Formula: Σ (Probability × Impact)

Example:
Risk 1: 3 × 4 = 12
Risk 2: 4 × 3 = 12
Risk 3: 2 × 5 = 10
Total Exposure: 34

Track over time to see if increasing or decreasing
```

**Risk Burndown**:
```
Number of open risks over time
Track: Open vs Closed vs Realized

Goal: Decreasing trend as mitigation takes effect
```

### Risk Status Tracking

```
Identified → Analyzed → Response Planned → Mitigating → Closed/Realized

Identified: Risk recognized
Analyzed: Probability/impact assessed
Response Planned: Mitigation strategy defined
Mitigating: Actions in progress
Closed: Risk no longer relevant (avoided/mitigated)
Realized: Risk occurred (executing contingency)
```

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering risk register:

- [ ] **Completeness**: All identifiable risks captured
- [ ] **Analysis**: Probability and impact assessed for each
- [ ] **Prioritization**: Risk scores calculated and prioritized
- [ ] **Response plans**: Strategy defined for high/critical risks
- [ ] **Owners**: Each risk assigned to responsible person
- [ ] **Triggers**: Warning signs identified
- [ ] **Contingencies**: Backup plans for high-impact risks
- [ ] **Review dates**: Next review scheduled
- [ ] **Categories**: Risks categorized (Technical, Schedule, Cost, etc.)
- [ ] **Documentation**: Clear, actionable descriptions

## Template Integration

```bash
# Use risk-register-template.xlsx as starting point
# Located in: plugins/project-manager/templates/

# Read template
cat plugins/project-manager/templates/risk-register-template.xlsx

# Populate with identified risks
# Export updated register
```

## Edge Cases

**Too many risks identified (>50)**:
- Focus on top 20 by score
- Group related risks
- Create summary-level risks
- Maintain detailed list but report on priorities

**Disagreement on probability/impact**:
- Document different viewpoints
- Use average or consensus
- Escalate to sponsor if critical
- Revisit in next review

**Risk occurs (realized)**:
- Update status to "Realized"
- Execute contingency plan
- Document lessons learned
- Create new risks if contingency creates them

**New risks mid-project**:
- Add to register immediately
- Analyze and prioritize
- Don't wait for next review if high priority
- Alert PM and stakeholders

## Best Practices

1. **Involve the team**: Best risk identification comes from those doing the work
2. **Be specific**: "Database performance issues" not "Technical problems"
3. **Focus on impact**: What happens if the risk occurs?
4. **Quantify when possible**: "30% probability" not "might happen"
5. **Own it**: Assign every risk to someone
6. **Monitor triggers**: Early warning = more options
7. **Update regularly**: Risks change; so should the register
8. **Don't hide bad news**: Surface risks early
9. **Plan for contingencies**: Hope for best, plan for worst
10. **Learn from realized risks**: Feed into future risk identification

## Integration with Other Agents

### From project-planner
```bash
# Receive project plan
# Analyze for risks:
- Aggressive timeline → Schedule risk
- New technology → Technical risk
- Complex dependencies → Integration risk
- Single resource → Resource risk
```

### To status-reporter
```bash
# Provide top risks for status report
# Include in weekly/monthly updates
# Alert on changes to high-priority risks
```

## Upon Completion

Report to user:
