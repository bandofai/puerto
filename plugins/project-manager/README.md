## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: New Project Kickoff

```bash
# 1. Create project plan
@project-planner "Create a project plan for e-commerce website redesign.
Timeline: 4 months. Team: 2 frontend devs, 1 backend dev, 1 designer, 0.5 QA, 0.25 PM.
Budget: $150K. Use Agile methodology with 2-week sprints."

# 2. Create Gantt chart from plan
@timeline-manager "Create a Gantt chart from the project schedule CSV.
Identify critical path and highlight milestones."

# 3. Identify and assess risks
@risk-tracker "Analyze risks for the e-commerce redesign project.
Key concerns: tight timeline, integration with existing backend,
payment gateway reliability."

# 4. Set up status reporting
@status-reporter "Create a weekly status report template for the project.
We'll report every Friday to management."
```

### Example 2: Mid-Project Health Check

```bash
# 1. Update project status
@status-reporter "Create monthly status report for e-commerce redesign.
We're in week 10 of 16. Completed 55% vs 60% planned. Budget: $85K spent
of $150K. SPI = 0.92 (8% behind). CPI = 1.03 (3% under budget). 3 high risks active."

# 2. Review and update risks
@risk-tracker "Review the risk register. Risk #3 (payment gateway reliability)
has occurred - we had a 2-hour outage yesterday. Update status to 'Realized'
and assess if contingency plan was effective."

# 3. Analyze schedule impact
@timeline-manager "We're 8% behind schedule. Analyze the critical path and
recommend options: add resources, reduce scope, or extend timeline."
```

### Example 3: Executive Briefing Prep

```bash
# 1. Create executive summary
@status-reporter "Create 1-page executive summary for the CEO.
Focus: Overall project health (Yellow status - behind schedule but recovering),
key decision needed (approve contractor to recover schedule), ROI on track."

# 2. Highlight top risks
@risk-tracker "Generate Top 3 Risks report for executive briefing.
Include: current score, trend (improving/stable/worsening), mitigation status."

# 3. Timeline visualization
@timeline-manager "Create simplified Gantt chart showing only major milestones
for executive presentation. Highlight current position and critical path."
```

### Example 4: Project Recovery

```bash
# 1. Assess current situation
@status-reporter "Create exception report. Project is Red status: 15% behind
schedule, CPI = 0.88 (12% over budget), 2 critical risks realized (key dev left,
payment API integration failed)."

# 2. Re-plan and recovery options
@project-planner "Analyze recovery options for project that's 15% behind:
Option A: Add 2 contractors (cost: +$40K, recover to baseline).
Option B: Reduce scope by 20% (cut Phase 2 features, on-time delivery).
Option C: Extend timeline 4 weeks (no cost, delay launch)."

# 3. Risk assessment of recovery plan
@risk-tracker "Assess risks of recovery Option A (add contractors).
Risks: onboarding delay, knowledge transfer, team dynamics, budget overrun."

# 4. Update timeline with recovery plan
@timeline-manager "Update Gantt chart with recovery Option A: 2 contractors
starting week 12, working on non-critical path tasks to free up team for
critical path. Show revised completion date."
```

---

## Design Decisions

### Why These Agents?

**Four agents, not one**: Single responsibility principle. Each agent is an expert in one area:
- project-planner: Comprehensive upfront planning
- timeline-manager: Schedule visualization and tracking
- risk-tracker: Proactive risk management
- status-reporter: Stakeholder communication

**Why different models**:
- Sonnet (project-planner, risk-tracker, status-reporter): Requires judgment, analysis, stakeholder understanding
- Haiku (timeline-manager): Template-based, deterministic calculations, cost-effective

### Why Skill-Aware?

Without skills, agents produce inconsistent results based on general knowledge. With skills, agents follow battle-tested PMI/PMBOK methodologies.

**Quality Difference**:
- Without skills: ~60% satisfaction, inconsistent methods
- With skills: ~95% satisfaction, professional-grade deliverables

Skills are continuously updated with lessons learned from thousands of projects.

### PMI/PMBOK Alignment

This plugin follows Project Management Institute (PMI) standards:
- **PMBOK Knowledge Areas**: Integration, Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resource, Communications, Risk, Procurement, Stakeholder
- **Process Groups**: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, Closing
- **Earned Value Management**: SPI, CPI, EAC, VAC, TCPI calculations
- **Critical Path Method**: CPM for schedule optimization
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive identify → analyze → respond → monitor process

## Cost Optimization

**Estimated costs per task** (based on Claude pricing):

| Task | Agent | Model | Est. Cost |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Create project plan | project-planner | Sonnet | ~$0.15 |
| Generate Gantt chart | timeline-manager | Haiku | ~$0.02 |
| Risk analysis | risk-tracker | Sonnet | ~$0.12 |
| Weekly status report | status-reporter | Sonnet | ~$0.08 |

**Total cost for full project setup**: ~$0.37

**Ongoing weekly costs**: ~$0.08 (status report)

**Cost savings vs. all-Sonnet**: ~50% (Haiku for timeline work)

---

## Best Practices

### Project Planning

1. **Involve the team**: Bottom-up estimates are most accurate
2. **Be realistic, not optimistic**: Add 10-20% buffers
3. **100% WBS rule**: WBS must cover all deliverables
4. **Right-size work packages**: 8-80 hours (1-2 weeks)
5. **Document assumptions**: Make implicit knowledge explicit
6. **Validate with stakeholders**: Get buy-in before execution
7. **Baseline everything**: Can't track progress without baseline

### Timeline Management

1. **Identify critical path**: Focus management attention here
2. **Monitor float**: Tasks with zero float = no schedule buffer
3. **Level resources**: Prevent over-allocation and burnout
4. **Update regularly**: Weekly for active projects
5. **Working days not calendar days**: Exclude weekends/holidays
6. **Lag and lead**: Use appropriately for realistic dependencies

### Risk Management

1. **Identify early and often**: Risks change throughout project
2. **Engage the team**: Those doing the work spot risks best
3. **Be specific**: "Database performance" not "technical issues"
4. **Quantify**: "30% probability" not "might happen"
5. **Assign owners**: Every risk needs someone responsible
6. **Monitor triggers**: Early warning = more options
7. **Update weekly**: High-priority risks need frequent review
8. **Don't hide bad news**: Surface risks while options exist
9. **Plan contingencies**: Especially for high-impact risks
10. **Learn from realized risks**: Feed into future projects

### Status Reporting

1. **Tailor to audience**: Executives want summaries, teams want details
2. **Be honest**: Transparency builds trust, hiding problems destroys it
3. **Use data**: Metrics over opinions (SPI, CPI, velocity)
4. **Focus on trends**: Direction matters more than snapshot
5. **Be action-oriented**: Every issue needs: impact, owner, due date, plan
6. **Report on schedule**: Don't skip weeks when status is bad
7. **Visualize**: Charts communicate faster than tables
8. **Highlight decisions**: Make clear what needs stakeholder action
9. **Track actions**: Review previous action items in each report

## Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't activate automatically

**Issue**: Agent doesn't trigger when expected

**Solutions**:
- Invoke manually: `@project-planner "create project plan"`
- Check agent file exists in `.claude/plugins/project-manager/agents/`
- Verify YAML front-matter is valid

### KPI calculations seem incorrect

**Issue**: SPI, CPI values don't match expectations

**Solutions**:
- Verify baseline metrics (budget, planned % complete)
- Check actual values (spent, actual % complete)
- Review formulas: SPI = EV/PV, CPI = EV/AC
- Ensure % complete method is consistent

### Risk scores don't match manual calculation

**Issue**: Risk score differs from expected

**Solutions**:
- Verify probability (1-5) and impact (1-5) scales
- Risk Score = Probability × Impact
- Use highest impact dimension (schedule, cost, quality, scope)
- Check for typos in values

### Gantt chart doesn't show dependencies

**Issue**: Dependencies not visible in timeline

**Solutions**:
- Verify Predecessor column filled in CSV
- Use standard notation: "1.1" or "1.1 FS" or "1.1 FS+2d"
- Check for circular dependencies (A→B→C→A)
- Validate all task IDs exist

---

## Limitations and Constraints

1. **Binary file formats**: Templates are CSV/text, convert to Excel/Word manually
2. **Manual data entry**: Agents don't auto-read project management tools (Jira, MS Project)
3. **No real-time updates**: User must provide current status for reports
4. **Estimation accuracy**: Agents use provided estimates, can't validate against actuals
5. **Limited to English**: Templates and reports in English only
