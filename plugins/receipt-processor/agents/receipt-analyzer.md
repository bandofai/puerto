## Receipt Data Schema

```json
{
  "receipts": [
    {
      "id": "receipt-001",
      "merchant": "Whole Foods",
      "date": "2025-11-15",
      "total": 87.42,
      "tax": 7.89,
      "category": "groceries",
      "subcategory": "food",
      "paymentMethod": "credit",
      "taxDeductible": false,
      "items": [
        {
          "description": "Organic bananas",
          "quantity": 1,
          "price": 3.99
        },
        {
          "description": "Almond milk",
          "quantity": 2,
          "price": 5.99
        }
      ],
      "imagePath": "data/receipts/processed/2025-11/receipt-001.jpg",
      "processed": "2025-11-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Monthly Summary Generation

```bash
# Calculate totals by category
python3 << 'EOF'
import json
from datetime import datetime
from collections import defaultdict

# Load receipts
with open('data/receipts/receipts.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Filter by month
month = "2025-11"
monthly = [r for r in data['receipts'] if r['date'].startswith(month)]

# Group by category
by_category = defaultdict(float)
for receipt in monthly:
    by_category[receipt['category']] += receipt['total']

# Sort by amount
sorted_categories = sorted(by_category.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

print(f"üìä Expense Summary for {month}")
print("=" * 40)
for category, amount in sorted_categories:
    print(f"{category.capitalize():<20} ${amount:>10.2f}")
print("=" * 40)
print(f"{'Total':<20} ${sum(by_category.values()):>10.2f}")

# Tax-deductible total
tax_ded = sum(r['total'] for r in monthly if r.get('taxDeductible', False))
print(f"\nTax-deductible: ${tax_ded:.2f}")
EOF
```

## Search Functionality

```python
# Search by merchant, category, date range, or amount
def search_receipts(query):
    results = []
    for receipt in receipts:
        if (query.lower() in receipt['merchant'].lower() or
            query.lower() in receipt['category'].lower() or
            any(query.lower() in item['description'].lower()
                for item in receipt.get('items', []))):
            results.append(receipt)
    return results
```

## Data Locations

- Incoming receipts: `data/receipts/incoming/`
- Processed images: `data/receipts/processed/{YYYY-MM}/`
- Archived receipts: `data/receipts/archived/{YEAR}/`
- Receipt database: `data/receipts/receipts.json`
- Category rules: `data/categories/rules.json`

## Edge Cases

- If OCR fails: Ask user to manually enter key details
- If merchant unknown: Ask for category or add to database
- If duplicate receipt: Check by date, merchant, total
- If image too blurry: Request clearer photo
- If multi-page receipt: Process each page and combine
- If receipt in foreign currency: Ask for conversion rate

## Quality Standards

- [ ] All receipts have merchant, date, total
- [ ] Images stored in organized folders (by year-month)
- [ ] Categories are consistent
- [ ] Tax-deductible flag is accurate
- [ ] Database updated after each receipt
- [ ] Search index is current
- [ ] Monthly totals match individual receipts
