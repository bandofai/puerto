### Category Best Practices

**Keep Categories Simple**:
```
Too Few Categories (Bad):
- Food
- Bills
- Other
Problem: Not enough detail for insights

Too Many Categories (Bad):
- Groceries - Produce
- Groceries - Meat
- Groceries - Dairy
- Groceries - Bread
- [50 more categories...]
Problem: Too complex, hard to maintain

Goldilocks (Good):
- 10-20 major categories
- 2-5 subcategories each
- Consistent naming
- Clear definitions
```

**Category Rules**:
1. **Mutually Exclusive**: Expense fits in only one category
2. **Collectively Exhaustive**: Every expense has a category
3. **Meaningful**: Categories align with budgeting goals
4. **Consistent**: Same merchant = same category always
5. **Actionable**: Can make decisions based on category totals

**Split Transactions**:
```
Example: Costco purchase
Total: $250

Split:
- Groceries: $120
- Household items: $50
- Electronics: $80

Why Split:
- More accurate category totals
- Better budget tracking
- Clearer spending patterns
```

## Receipt Digitization Best Practices

### Why Digitize Receipts?

**Benefits**:
- No physical storage needed
- Won't fade or deteriorate
- Searchable and organized
- Easy to share with accountant
- Required for tax audits
- Cloud backup protection
- OCR data extraction

**IRS Requirements**:
- Must keep records for 3-7 years
- Digital copies acceptable (Rev. Proc. 97-22)
- Must be legible and accurate
- Must match original receipt

### Receipt Capture Methods

**Mobile Apps** (Recommended):
```
Popular Apps:
- Expensify: Photo + OCR + expense reports
- Shoeboxed: Receipt scanning service
- QuickBooks: Built-in receipt capture
- Wave: Free receipt scanning
- Evernote: General document scanning
- Adobe Scan: High-quality PDF scanning

Process:
1. Take photo immediately after purchase
2. App extracts data via OCR
3. Verify merchant, amount, category
4. Cloud storage automatic
5. Original receipt can be discarded (usually)
```

**Flatbed Scanner**:
```
Use Cases:
- Large batches of receipts
- Important documents requiring high quality
- Legal documents

Process:
1. Scan at 300+ DPI
2. Save as PDF
3. Name file: [Date]-[Merchant]-[Amount].pdf
4. Store in organized folder structure
5. Backup to cloud
```

**Email Receipts**:
```
Digital receipts sent to email

Process:
1. Create dedicated email address (receipts@...)
2. Forward all receipt emails
3. Use automated tools to extract:
   - Gmail filters + Google Sheets
   - Zapier automation
   - Receipt Bank
4. Export to expense tracking software
```

### Photo Best Practices

**Lighting & Focus**:
```
Do:
- Use natural light or bright indoor light
- Hold phone steady
- Ensure entire receipt is visible
- Check focus before capturing
- Capture receipt flat (not crumpled)

Don't:
- Use flash (causes glare)
- Capture in dim lighting
- Cut off edges
- Blur text
- Include background clutter
```

**Receipt Condition**:
```
Before Receipt Fades:
- Thermal receipts fade in 3-6 months
- Capture within 24 hours of purchase
- If faded, try enhancing contrast

If Receipt is Damaged:
- Flatten crumpled receipts
- Tape torn receipts
- Capture both sides if needed
- Note any missing information
```

**File Naming Convention**:
```
Format: YYYY-MM-DD_Merchant_Amount_Category.pdf

Examples:
2024-10-15_Whole-Foods_124.53_Groceries.pdf
2024-10-18_Shell_45.00_Fuel.pdf
2024-10-20_AWS_89.99_Software-Business.pdf

Benefits:
- Sortable by date
- Searchable by merchant

- Consistent organization
```

### OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

**What OCR Extracts**:
```
Key Fields:
- Merchant name
- Date of purchase
- Total amount
- Tax amount
- Payment method
- Line items (sometimes)
- Category suggestions

Accuracy:
- Good receipts: 95%+ accuracy
- Faded receipts: 70-80% accuracy
- Handwritten: 50-60% accuracy
```

**Manual Verification Required**:
```
Always Verify:
â Total amount (most important!)
â Date (OCR often misreads dates)
â Merchant name (sometimes abbreviated)
â Category (AI suggestion may be wrong)

Common OCR Errors:
- "1" reads as "I" or "l"
- "8" reads as "B"
- "0" reads as "O"
- Decimal point misplaced
- Date format confusion (MM/DD vs DD/MM)
```

### Cloud Storage & Backup

**Recommended Storage**:
```
Cloud Services:
- Google Drive: Free 15GB, good search
- Dropbox: Excellent sync, paid

Folder Structure:
/Receipts
  /2024
    /01-January
    /02-February
    ...
  /2023
  /2022
  ...
```

**Backup Strategy**:
```
3-2-1 Rule:
- 3 copies of data
- 2 different storage types
- 1 offsite backup

Example:
1. Primary: Expensify app
2. Secondary: Google Drive backup
3. Offsite: External hard drive (annual backup)
```

```

```

### Red Flags to Avoid

**Audit Triggers**:
```
ð© Red Flags:
- 100% business use of vehicle (unrealistic)
- Home office claims (high scrutiny)
- Excessive meal/entertainment (lavish test)
- Round numbers (looks estimated)
- Disproportionate to income
- Personal expenses misclassified
- Cash businesses (high non-compliance)

Stay Safe:
- Be honest and accurate
- Keep detailed records
- Only claim legitimate expenses
- Don't round to even numbers
- Document everything
```

**Conservative Approach**:
```
When in Doubt:
- Don't claim it
- Consult tax professional
- Over-document
- Use lower percentage if unsure

Examples:
Cell phone: Unsure if 70% or 80% business?
â Claim 70% (conservative)

Home office: Technically 12% but includes hallway?
â Claim 10% (clearly business only)
```

### Reconciliation Process

**Bank Reconciliation**:
```
Purpose: Ensure all expenses recorded and categorized

Weekly Process:
1. Download bank/credit card transactions
2. Match transactions to receipts
3. Categorize each transaction
4. Flag any missing receipts
5. Note any disputed/fraudulent charges

Monthly Process:
1. Download statement
2. Verify all transactions recorded
3. Check for duplicates
4. Identify missing receipts
5. Calculate totals by category
6. Compare to budget
7. Investigate variances
```

**Receipt Matching**:
```
Match Each Transaction:

Bank Transaction: $87.43 - Office Depot - Oct 15
Receipt: 2024-10-15_Office-Depot_87.43_Office-Supplies.pdf
Status: â Matched

Bank Transaction: $45.00 - Shell - Oct 18
Receipt: Missing
Action: â ï¸ Reconstruct from memory, note "Receipt missing"

Bank Transaction: $120.00 - ABC Services - Oct 20
Receipt: None found
Action: ð Research transaction, contact merchant if needed
```

**Discrepancy Resolution**:
```
Common Issues:

Resolution: Use bank amount (authoritative), note discrepancy

Issue: Date doesn't match
Example: Bank posts Oct 16, receipt dated Oct 15
Resolution: Use receipt date (transaction date), note post date

Issue: Duplicate charge
Example: Charged twice for same purchase
Resolution: Dispute with bank, mark one as "Disputed - refund pending"

Issue: Unknown merchant
Example: "SQ *Random Name" (Square payment)
Resolution: Research, contact merchant, use credit card detail if available
