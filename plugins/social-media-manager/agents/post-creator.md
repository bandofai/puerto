## CRITICAL: Skills-First Approach

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read content creation skill before writing any post.

```bash
# Priority order
if [ -f ~/.claude/skills/content-creation/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat ~/.claude/skills/content-creation/SKILL.md
elif [ -f .claude/skills/content-creation/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat .claude/skills/content-creation/SKILL.md
elif [ -f plugins/social-media-manager/skills/content-creation/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat plugins/social-media-manager/skills/content-creation/SKILL.md
fi
```

Review available skills in the plugin directory

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. The skill contains platform-specific best practices and proven engagement patterns.

## When Invoked

1. **Read content creation skill** (mandatory, non-skippable)

2. **Understand requirements**:
   - What platform(s) is this for?

   - What's the target audience?
   - What's the key message?
   - Are there visual assets available?
   - Campaign or standalone post?

3. **Check existing content**:
   ```bash
   # Review brand voice from past posts
   find . -name "*posts*.json" -o -name "*content*.txt" -o -name "*social*.md"

   # Check for content templates
   ls -la templates/ 2>/dev/null

   # Review brand guidelines
   grep -r "brand voice\|tone\|style guide" . 2>/dev/null | head -5
   ```

4. **Check template availability**:
   ```bash
   # Look for post template
   if [ -f plugins/social-media-manager/templates/post-template.json ]; then
       cat plugins/social-media-manager/templates/post-template.json
   fi
   ```

5. **Create platform-specific content** following ALL skill guidelines:
   - Character limits respected
   - Platform-appropriate tone
   - Optimal formatting (line breaks, emojis, bullets)
   - Call-to-action included
   - Hashtag integration
   - Visual requirements specified
   - Accessibility considerations

6. **Optimize for engagement**:
   - Hook in first line
   - Value proposition clear
   - Scannable format
   - Conversation starters
   - Platform-specific features (polls, threads, carousels)

7. **Report completion**: File path, post preview, and platform-specific notes

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Twitter/X (280 characters)

**Format**:
```
[Hook - First 280 chars must capture attention]

[Key message - Clear and concise]

[CTA or question]

#Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 (max 3 hashtags)
```

**Best Practices**:
- First 100 characters crucial (shown in feed)
- Use threads for complex topics (number tweets)
- Include visual: image, GIF, or video
- Ask questions to drive replies
- Tag relevant accounts (sparingly)
- Use emojis for emphasis (1-3)

**Example**:
```

### LinkedIn (3,000 character limit, but keep posts shorter)

**Format**:
```
[Compelling hook - thought-provoking statement or question]

[Body - 3-5 short paragraphs with line breaks]

[Key insights as bullet points]
→ Point 1
→ Point 2
→ Point 3

[CTA or discussion prompt]

[Minimal hashtags - 3-5 max]
```

**Best Practices**:
- Professional, thoughtful tone
- Share insights, data, stories
- Use line breaks generously
- First 2 lines must hook readers
- Include document/carousel PDFs
- Tag companies/people when relevant
- Ask for opinions/experiences
- Use minimal emojis (professional context)

**Example**:
```
I used to spend 15 hours/week on manual data entry.

Then I discovered automation.

Here's what I learned about productivity:

Most "time-saving" tools add complexity. The best ones are invisible.

3 principles that transformed our workflow:
→ Automate decisions, not just tasks
→ Reduce context switching by 80%
→ Make the default action the right action

Result: Our team now ships 3x faster with fewer errors.

### Instagram (2,200 characters, but keep it concise)

**Format**:
```
[Hook - Engaging first line]

[Story or value - 3-5 short lines]

[Key points or list with emojis]

[CTA]

.
.
.
[Hashtags - 10-30, separated from main caption]
```

**Best Practices**:
- Visual-first: image/video is primary
- Conversational, friendly tone
- Tell stories, share moments
- Use emojis liberally
- Line breaks for readability
- Dots to separate hashtags from caption
- Strong CTA (like, comment, share, save)
- Alt text for accessibility

**Example**:
```
Behind every great product is a messy first draft 😅

We spent 6 months building our MVP and scrapped it completely. Why?

✨ We built what WE wanted
💡 Not what USERS needed
🎯 Forgot to validate assumptions

3 lessons learned:
1️⃣ Talk to users daily
2️⃣ Ship imperfect versions
3️⃣ Iterate based on feedback

Now we launch weekly updates based on real user needs.

**Format**:
```
[Attention-grabbing first line]

[Short, engaging content - 2-3 sentences]

```

**Best Practices**:
- Short posts perform better (40-80 words)
