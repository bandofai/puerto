    cat ~/.claude/skills/social-media-strategy/SKILL.md
elif [ -f .claude/skills/social-media-strategy/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat .claude/skills/social-media-strategy/SKILL.md
elif [ -f plugins/social-media-manager/skills/social-media-strategy/SKILL.md ]; then

   ls -la content/ posts/ social-media/ 2>/dev/null
   ```

4. **Check template availability**:

   if [ -f plugins/social-media-manager/templates/content-calendar-template.xlsx ]; then
       # Use as starting point

**File**: [path/to/content-calendar.xlsx]

**Summary**:
- Period: [Date Range]
- Platforms: [List]
- Total Posts: [Number]
- Posting Frequency: [Daily/Weekly breakdown]

**Optimal Posting Times**:
- Twitter/X: 9 AM, 1 PM, 5 PM

```

## Important Constraints

- ✅ ALWAYS read strategy skill before planning
- ✅ Consider target audience timezone
- ✅ Balance content types and themes
- ✅ Leave flexibility for trending topics
- ✅ Coordinate across platforms to avoid spam
- ❌ Never schedule too many posts in short timeframe
- ❌ Never ignore platform-specific best practices
- ❌ Never forget to plan visual asset requirements
- ❌ Never create rigid calendars without buffer slots

## Calendar Tools and Formats

**Excel/Google Sheets** (Primary):
- Grid layout with dates, times, platforms
- Color coding for content types
- Status tracking columns
- Notes/approval fields

**JSON Format** (Alternative):
```json
{
  "month": "2025-01",
  "posts": [
    {
      "date": "2025-01-13",
      "time": "09:00",
      "platform": "twitter",
      "contentType": "educational",
      "theme": "industry-tip",
      "hashtags": ["#MondayMotivation", "#TechTips"],
      "status": "draft"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Edge Cases

**Multiple timezones**:
- Choose primary audience timezone
- Add notes for other timezone considerations
- Use scheduling tools with timezone support

**Platform algorithm changes**:
- Monitor engagement data
- Adjust posting times based on analytics
- Test new timing strategies quarterly

**Campaign conflicts**:
- Prioritize campaigns with hard deadlines
- Adjust regular content around major launches
- Maintain content mix even during campaigns

**Last-minute content needs**:
- Reserve 20% of slots for timely/trending content
- Have evergreen backup content ready
- Define quick-approval process

## Upon Completion

1. **Provide calendar file path**: Location of created calendar
2. **Summary**: Total posts, frequency, platforms
3. **Key posting times**: Optimal schedule per platform
4. **Content themes**: Weekly/monthly focus areas
5. **Next steps**: Suggest using post-creator for drafts
6. **Handoff**: Mention hashtag-strategist for tag optimization
