# Analytics Skill

**Metrics tracking patterns for engagement, reach, conversions, and comprehensive social media reporting**

This skill provides proven frameworks for tracking, analyzing, and reporting on social media performance.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Track What Matters**: Focus on metrics that drive business goals
2. **Context Over Numbers**: Raw metrics mean nothing without comparison
3. **Actionable Insights**: Every metric should inform a decision
4. **Trends Over Snapshots**: Look at patterns, not single data points
5. **Iterate Based on Data**: Let performance guide strategy

## Key Metrics Framework

### Tier 1: North Star Metrics (Track Weekly)

These metrics directly impact business goals:

**Engagement Rate**:
```
Engagement Rate = (Likes + Comments + Shares + Saves) / Reach × 100
```
- Most important metric for content quality
- Shows how compelling your content is
- Compare to historical average and industry benchmarks

**Follower Growth Rate**:
```
Growth Rate = (New Followers - Unfollows) / Starting Followers × 100
```
- Indicates account health and reach expansion
- Track weekly to catch trends early
- Negative growth signals content/strategy issues

**Click-Through Rate (CTR)**:
```
CTR = Clicks / Impressions × 100
```
- Measures CTA effectiveness
- Shows intent and interest level
- Critical for conversion-focused content

---

### Tier 2: Performance Metrics (Track Daily)

These metrics show content effectiveness:

**Reach**:
- Unique users who saw your content
- Organic vs paid breakdown
- Platform-specific nuances matter

**Impressions**:
- Total times content was displayed
- Can exceed reach (same user sees multiple times)
- High impressions + low engagement = content issue

**Saves (Instagram, LinkedIn)**:
- Strongest signal of valuable content
- Algorithm boost on Instagram
- Users find it reference-worthy

**Shares/Retweets**:
- Highest value engagement action
- Extends reach beyond followers
- Shows content resonates deeply

**Video Completion Rate**:
```
Completion Rate = Full Video Views / Video Starts × 100
```
- Critical for video content success
- First 3 seconds make or break
- Platform algorithms heavily weight this

---

### Tier 3: Vanity Metrics (Context Needed)

These metrics need context to be useful:

**Total Followers**:
- Growth rate matters more than total
- 10K engaged followers > 100K dormant followers
- Quality over quantity

**Total Likes**:
- Engagement rate is more meaningful
- Easy, low-value action
- Likes alone don't indicate success

**Impressions (alone)**:
- Meaningless without engagement context
- 1M impressions with 0 engagement = failure
- Always pair with engagement metrics

---

## Platform-Specific Analytics

### Twitter/X Analytics

**Access**: Twitter Analytics dashboard (analytics.twitter.com)

**Key Metrics to Track**:

1. **Tweet Impressions**: How many times tweets were seen
2. **Engagement Rate**: Engagements / Impressions
3. **Profile Visits**: Interest in your account
4. **Mention**: Brand awareness indicator
5. **Top Tweet**: What resonated most
6. **Follower Demographics**: Location, interests

**Twitter-Specific Calculations**:

```
Amplification Rate = Retweets / Followers × 100
(Measures share-worthiness)

Applause Rate = Likes / Impressions × 100
(Measures content resonance)

Conversation Rate = Replies / Impressions × 100
(Measures discussion generation)
```

**What to Track**:
- Best performing tweets by engagement rate
- Optimal posting times (when YOUR audience engages)
- Thread performance vs single tweets
- Media tweet performance (image/video vs text)

**Red Flags**:
- Declining engagement rate over time
- High impressions but low engagement (content quality issue)
- Follower growth plateau or decline
- Increasing profile visits but not followers (conversion issue)

---

### LinkedIn Analytics

**Access**: LinkedIn Page Analytics

**Key Metrics to Track**:

1. **Impressions**: Organic vs viral breakdown
2. **Unique Viewers**: How many people saw content
3. **Engagement Rate**: Total engagements / Impressions
4. **Click-Through Rate**: Link clicks / Impressions
5. **Follower Demographics**: Job titles, industries, seniority
6. **Visitor Analytics**: Who's viewing your profile

**LinkedIn-Specific Metrics**:

```
Social Selling Index (SSI) = Your professional brand score
(0-100, track monthly)

Viral Impressions = Shares × Average follower count
(Measures content spread beyond your network)
```

**What to Track**:
- Carousel/Document post performance (typically highest reach)
- Engagement by post type (article vs native vs link)
- Connection growth from posts
- Visitor sources (search, shares, direct)

**LinkedIn Algorithm Signals**:
- Dwell time (keep readers on platform)
- Early engagement (first hour crucial)
- Comments > Reactions > Shares (weighted differently)
- Personal posts often outperform company page posts

**Red Flags**:
- Low dwell time (readers leave quickly)
- High impressions but low unique viewers (shown repeatedly to same people)
- External link posts get low reach (algorithm penalty)

---

### Instagram Analytics

**Access**: Instagram Insights (in-app)

**Key Metrics to Track**:

1. **Reach**: How many unique accounts saw your content
2. **Impressions**: Total views (reach × frequency)
3. **Engagement Rate**: (Likes + Comments + Saves + Shares) / Reach × 100
4. **Saves**: Strongest quality signal
5. **Profile Visits**: Interest indicator
6. **Follows from Post**: Conversion metric
7. **Story Metrics**: Replies, exits, forward/back taps

**Instagram-Specific Metrics**:

```
Save Rate = Saves / Reach × 100
(Instagram's #1 quality signal, aim for >5%)

Story Completion Rate = Final Frame Views / First Frame Views × 100
(Measures story engagement)

Reel Retention = Average Watch Time / Video Length × 100
(Critical for Reels performance)
```

**What to Track**:
- Reel performance (reach beyond followers)
- Carousel save rate (educational content indicator)
- Story engagement features (polls, questions, quizzes)
- Best hashtag sets (track performance by rotation set)

**Instagram Algorithm Signals**:
- Saves (highest priority)
- Shares to DMs (strong signal)
- Time spent on post (dwell time)
- Comments and replies
- Profile visits after seeing post

**Red Flags**:
- Low save rate (<2% consistently)
- High exits on Stories (losing viewers)
- Reach not extending beyond followers (algorithm not boosting)
- Decreasing Reel views (trend fatigue)

---

### Facebook Analytics

**Access**: Facebook Page Insights

**Key Metrics to Track**:

1. **Reach**: Organic vs paid breakdown
2. **Engagement Rate**: Actions / Reach × 100
3. **Video Views**: Total and average watch time
4. **Page Views**: Interest in your business
5. **Page Likes**: Growth over time
6. **Post Clicks**: Link clicks, photo views

**Facebook-Specific Metrics**:

```
Engagement Rate = (Reactions + Comments + Shares + Clicks) / Reach × 100

Video Retention = Average Watch Time / Video Length × 100
(Critical for video content)

Virality = Shares / Reach × 100
(How share-worthy is your content)
```

**What to Track**:
- Organic reach decline (typical, plan accordingly)
- Video completion rates (Facebook prioritizes video)
- Peak online times (when to post)
- Top posts by reach and engagement

**Facebook Algorithm Signals**:
- Meaningful interactions (comments, shares > likes)
- Time spent on post (video watch time)
- Friends/family engagement (weighted higher)
- Recency (newer content prioritized)

**Red Flags**:
- Declining organic reach (common but track rate)
- Low video completion rates (<25%)
- High negative feedback (hide post, report, unlike)

---

### TikTok Analytics

**Access**: TikTok Pro Account (in-app)

**Key Metrics to Track**:

1. **Video Views**: Total plays
2. **Average Watch Time**: How long viewers stay
3. **Completion Rate**: % who watch to end
4. **Engagement Rate**: (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Views × 100
5. **Traffic Source**: FYP vs Following vs other
6. **Follower Growth**: New followers per video

**TikTok-Specific Metrics**:

```
Completion Rate = Full Video Watches / Video Starts × 100
(Most important TikTok metric, aim for >50%)

Loop Rate = Replays / Video Views × 100
(Strong signal to algorithm)

FYP Ratio = FYP Views / Total Views × 100
(>70% means algorithm is promoting you)
```

**What to Track**:
- First 3-second retention (make or break moment)
- Traffic source breakdown (FYP vs Following)
- Trending sounds performance
- Watch-through patterns (where viewers drop off)

**TikTok Algorithm Signals**:
- Completion rate (highest priority)
- Rewatches/loops (strong signal)
- Shares (highest value action)
- Comments (conversation value)
- Not interested/hidden (negative signals)

**Red Flags**:
- Low FYP percentage (<30%)
- Drop-offs in first 3 seconds (hook failure)

## ROI Calculation

### Organic Social Media ROI

```
ROI = (Value Generated - Time Investment) / Time Investment × 100

Where:
Value Generated =
  (Conversions × Average Value) +
  (Brand Awareness Value) +
  (Customer Support Savings)

Time Investment =
  (Content Creation Hours × Hourly Rate) +
  (Management Hours × Hourly Rate)
```

### Example Calculation:

```
TIME INVESTMENT:
• Content creation: 10 hrs/week × $50/hr = $500
• Management: 5 hrs/week × $50/hr = $250
• Total weekly investment: $750

VALUE GENERATED:
• Conversions: 20 sign-ups × $100 LTV = $2,000
• Brand awareness: Est. $500 (reach equivalent)
• Support savings: $200 (community answers questions)
• Total weekly value: $2,700

ROI = ($2,700 - $750) / $750 × 100 = 260% ROI
```

---

## A/B Testing Framework

### What to Test

**Content Variables**:
- Post copy variations (hooks, lengths)
- Visual styles (photos vs graphics vs videos)
- CTA placement (beginning vs end)
- Hashtag sets (different mixes)
- Emoji usage (amount and placement)

**Timing Variables**:
- Post times (morning vs afternoon vs evening)

- Frequency (1x vs 2x vs 3x per day)

**Format Variables**:
- Single image vs carousel
- Video length (15s vs 30s vs 60s)
- Thread vs single post
- Link post vs native content

### Testing Methodology

1. **Define Hypothesis**:
   "We believe [changing X] will increase [metric Y] by [Z%]"

2. **Test One Variable**:
   Change only ONE thing at a time

3. **Minimum Sample Size**:
   At least 30 posts per variation for statistical significance

4. **Control for Timing**:
   Test same day/time to remove timing variable

5. **Measure Results**:
   Compare engagement rate, not absolute numbers

6. **Implement Learnings**:
   Apply winning variation to strategy

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Check reach metrics (reaching new accounts?)
2. Analyze share rates (is content share-worthy?)
3. Review profile optimization (clear value prop?)
4. Compare to competitors (market-wide issue?)

**Solutions**:
- Create more shareable content
- Optimize profile bio and CTA
- Collaborate with others (cross-promotion)
- Leverage trending topics/sounds
- Use platform growth features (Reels, carousels)

---

### High Reach, Low Engagement

**Possible Causes**:
- Wrong audience being reached
- Content not compelling enough to engage
- Weak or missing CTA
- Audience mismatch with content

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Check audience demographics (right people?)
2. Analyze content quality (valuable enough?)
3. Review CTAs (clear and compelling?)
4. Compare to high-engagement posts (what's different?)

**Solutions**:
