## Tips & Best Practices

### Content Creation Tips

1. **Platform-Specific Optimization**: Never copy-paste same content across platforms
2. **Hook First**: First 3 seconds/lines determine scroll or engage

4. **Clear CTAs**: Every post should have a specific action you want users to take
5. **Accessibility**: Always add alt text to images, captions to videos

### Scheduling Tips

1. **Consistency Over Volume**: Better to post regularly than sporadically
2. **Audience Timezone**: Schedule for when YOUR audience is active (check analytics)
3. **Platform Variety**: Don't post on all platforms at same time (spread throughout day)
4. **Buffer Slots**: Reserve 20% of calendar for timely/trending content
5. **Batch Create**: Create content in batches to maintain consistency

### Engagement Tips

1. **Respond Quickly**: First hour is critical for algorithm boost
2. **Ask Questions**: Drive comments with thoughtful questions

4. **Monitor Mentions**: Set up alerts and respond to brand mentions
5. **Community First**: Focus on building relationships, not just broadcasting

2. **Context Matters**: Always compare metrics to previous periods or benchmarks
3. **Action-Oriented**: Every metric should inform a decision
4. **Test Regularly**: A/B test posting times, content types, hooks
5. **Document Learnings**: Keep notes on what works for your specific audience
