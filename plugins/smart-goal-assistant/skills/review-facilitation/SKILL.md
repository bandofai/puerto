# Review Facilitation Skill

## Overview

This skill provides frameworks for conducting effective goal reviews at weekly, monthly, and quarterly intervals. Reviews drive learning, adjustment, and sustained progress through structured reflection.

## Core Review Principles

### Principle 1: Start with Wins
Always begin by celebrating achievements. Motivation matters.

### Principle 2: Data Over Feelings
Base discussions on metrics and evidence, not impressions.

### Principle 3: Forward Focus
Spend 70% on future actions, 30% on past analysis.

### Principle 4: Root Cause Analysis
For recurring problems, dig deeper to systemic issues.

### Principle 5: Actionable Outcomes
Every review ends with specific, owned actions.

## Weekly Review Framework

### Purpose
Tactical adjustments, blocker resolution, momentum maintenance.

### Duration
15-30 minutes

### Structure

## Root Cause Analysis Technique

### The 5 Whys Method

```
Problem: Missed milestone deadline by 1 week

Why? â†’ Tasks took longer than estimated

Why? â†’ Encountered unexpected technical complexity

Why? â†’ Didn't do technical spike upfront

Why? â†’ No process for de-risking unknowns

Why? â†’ Team new, processes not established

Root Cause: Missing risk assessment process

Solution: Implement technical spike process for uncertain work
```

### Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram

```
Problem: Low velocity (only 5% per week, need 8%)

People:
- Team member out sick (temporary)
- New team member ramping up (temporary)

Process:
- Too many meetings (systemic)
- Unclear requirements (systemic)

Tools:
- Development environment slow (systemic)
- Testing framework brittle (systemic)

External:
- Waiting on vendor API docs (temporary)

Actions:
- Systemic issues: Reduce meetings, improve dev environment
- Temporary issues: Will resolve naturally, add buffer
```

## Review Facilitation Techniques

### Technique 1: Pre-Review Preparation

**Before review, prepare**:
- [ ] Update dashboard with latest data
- [ ] Gather metrics and trends
- [ ] List completed milestones
- [ ] List active blockers
- [ ] Note key decisions made
- [ ] Prepare questions to discuss

**Send to participants 24h before**:
- Dashboard
- Key topics to discuss
- Decisions needed

### Technique 2: Time-Boxing

```
Stick to allocated time per section:

Weekly (30 min total):
- Progress: 5 min
- Wins: 3 min
- Challenges: 7 min
- Learnings: 5 min
- Planning: 5 min
- Actions: 5 min

Set timer, keep moving. Defer deep dives to separate meetings.
```

### Technique 3: Celebration Ritual

```
Make wins visible and memorable:

ðŸŽ‰ Milestone completed?
  â†’ Ring bell, share on Slack, team kudos

ðŸ“Š Hit progress target?
  â†’ Update visual tracker, acknowledge effort

ðŸ”“ Blocker resolved?
  â†’ Thank whoever helped, document solution

Small celebrations maintain motivation.
```

### Technique 4: Plus/Delta Format

```
Plus (Keep doing):
- What worked well this [week/month]
- What to continue or amplify
- Positive patterns noticed

Delta (Change):
- What didn't work
- What to stop or modify
- Improvements needed

Simple, balanced, actionable.
```

### Technique 5: Start/Stop/Continue

```
START doing:
- [New behavior/approach to begin]

STOP doing:
- [Current behavior/approach to cease]

CONTINUE doing:
- [What's working, keep at it]

Forces concrete commitments.
```

## Action Item Management

### Effective Action Items

**Bad action item**:
"Improve communication"

**Good action item**:
"Set up weekly stakeholder update email (Alice, send first by Friday)"

**Characteristics of good action items**:
- **Specific**: Clear what to do
- **Owned**: One person responsible
- **Deadline**: When it's due
- **Prioritized**: Relative importance
- **Measurable**: Know when done

### Action Item Template

```markdown
| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Priority | Status |
|---|--------|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Escalate API blocker to vendor | Alice | Wed | High | Open |
| 2 | Reduce weekly meetings from 10 to 6 | Bob | Next week | Med | Open |
| 3 | Document learnings from M1 | Carol | Fri | Low | Done |
```

### Follow-Up Process

```
Every review:
1. Review action items from last review
2. Check status (done/in-progress/blocked)
3. Celebrate completed actions
4. Escalate blocked actions
5. Create new action items
6. Assign owners and deadlines

No orphan actions! Everything has owner and deadline.
```

## Trend Analysis

### Velocity Trends

```
Analyzing 4-week velocity:

Week 1: 6%
Week 2: 8%
Week 3: 7%
Week 4: 9%

Interpretation:
- Average: 7.5%
- Trend: â†‘ Improving (last week above average)
- Variability: Moderate (6-9% range)

Assessment: Positive trend, velocity increasing

Recommendation: Sustain current approach
```

### Progress Trajectory

```
Expected vs Actual:

Week 1: Expected 25%, Actual 15% (â¬‡ 10%)
Week 2: Expected 50%, Actual 28% (â¬‡ 22%)
Week 3: Expected 75%, Actual 45% (â¬‡ 30%)
Week 4: Expected 100%, Actual 62% (â¬‡ 38%)

Interpretation: Falling further behind each week

Assessment: ðŸ”´ Critical issue

Action: Trigger pivot analysis, consider major adjustment
```

### Blocker Patterns

```
Blocker history:

Month 1: 3 blockers, avg 4 days to resolve
Month 2: 5 blockers, avg 6 days to resolve
Month 3: 7 blockers, avg 9 days to resolve

Interpretation: Blockers increasing in frequency and duration

Root cause investigation:
- Why more blockers? (Increasing complexity? Unclear requirements?)
- Why taking longer? (Resource constraints? Unclear ownership?)

Recommendations: [Based on root cause]
```

## Review Documentation

### Minimal Documentation

**Must capture**:
- Date of review
- Overall status (ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´)
- Progress metrics
- Key decisions made
- Action items with owners
- Next review date

**Should capture**:
- Wins and learnings
- Obstacles and resolutions
- Trends observed
- Course corrections

**Nice to have**:
- Detailed discussion notes
- Rationale for decisions
- Alternatives considered

### Review Report Template

See agent templates for detailed formats.

Key principle: **Document decisions and actions, not every word spoken.**

## Integration with Other Agents

### Review â†’ Progress Tracker
```
Review identifies: "Need more frequent updates"
Action: @progress-tracker "Update from daily to twice-weekly"
```

### Review â†’ Pivot Advisor
```
Review identifies: "3 months behind, systemic issues"
Action: @pivot-advisor [goal-id] "Stuck due to resource constraints"
```

### Review â†’ Milestone Planner
```
Review identifies: "Scope creep on M3"
Action: @milestone-planner --revise "Descope M3, split into M3a and M3b"
```

## Common Review Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: The Status Report
```
Bad: Each person reports what they did
â†’ Boring, no discussion, no learning

Good: Review progress together, discuss obstacles, make decisions
```

### Anti-Pattern 2: The Blame Game
```
Bad: "You didn't finish X, why?"
â†’ Defensive, low psychological safety

Good: "X didn't get done, what blocked it? How can we help?"
```

### Anti-Pattern 3: The Action-less Review
```
Bad: Lots of discussion, no decisions or commitments
â†’ Waste of time

Good: Every issue discussed â†’ Action item with owner
```

### Anti-Pattern 4: The Sugarcoating
```
Bad: "Everything is fine!" (when it's not)
â†’ Prevents addressing real issues

Good: Honest assessment of status, both positive and negative
```

### Anti-Pattern 5: The Dwelling
```
Bad: Spending 45 minutes analyzing past failure
â†’ Diminishing returns, demoralizing

Good: Quick root cause, then pivot to forward actions
```

## Quarterly Review Framework

### Purpose
Major course correction, goal relevance check, strategic realignment.

### Duration
1-2 hours

### Additional Focus Areas

**Beyond monthly review, add**:

**1. Goal Relevance** (15 min)
```
Is this still the right goal?
- Has market changed?
- Have priorities shifted?
- Is ROI still attractive?
- Better opportunities emerged?

Decision: Continue / Adjust / Pivot / Retire
```

**2. Resource Assessment** (15 min)
```
Resource efficiency:
- Time investment: [Actual vs planned]
- Budget: [Spent vs allocated]
- People: [Utilization vs capacity]

ROI analysis:
- Value delivered: [Assessment]
- Value remaining: [Projection]
- Worth continued investment? [Yes/No/Depends]
```

**3. Long-term Planning** (15 min)
```
Next quarter focus:
- Primary objective
- Key milestones
- Resource needs
- Success metrics

Dependencies:
- What needs to happen first
- What we're waiting on
- Risks to plan
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Schedule reviews consistently** - Same day/time builds habit
2. **Prepare in advance** - Gather data before meeting
3. **Start with wins** - Maintain morale and momentum
4. **Be data-driven** - Metrics over opinions
5. **Dig for root causes** - Don't treat symptoms
6. **Focus forward** - Learning from past to improve future
7. **Create action items** - Concrete, owned, deadline
8. **Follow up** - Review previous actions every time
9. **Document decisions** - Capture rationale for future reference
10. **Celebrate progress** - Acknowledge effort and achievement

This skill should be read before conducting any goal review (weekly, monthly, or quarterly).
