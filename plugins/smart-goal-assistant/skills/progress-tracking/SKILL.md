# Progress Tracking Skill

## Overview

This skill provides efficient techniques for tracking goal progress, calculating velocity metrics, identifying trends, and generating actionable dashboards. Optimized for speed and clarity.

## Core Tracking Principles

### Principle 1: Track Leading and Lagging Indicators
**Lagging**: What happened (results, outcomes)
**Leading**: What's happening (activities, inputs that predict results)

### Principle 2: Keep It Simple
Track minimum viable metrics. Over-tracking creates overhead without insight.

### Principle 3: Make It Visual
Numbers alone don't tell the story. Use progress bars, trends, status indicators.

### Principle 4: Update Frequently
Weekly minimum. Daily for fast-moving goals.

### Principle 5: Flag Issues Early
Red/Yellow/Green status helps spot problems before they're critical.

## Essential Metrics

### 1. Overall Progress (%)
```
Calculation: Weighted by milestone duration

Example:
M1: Complete (100%) Ã— 2 weeks = 200
M2: Complete (100%) Ã— 3 weeks = 300
M3: In progress (60%) Ã— 2 weeks = 120
M4: Not started (0%) Ã— 3 weeks = 0

Total: 620 / (2+3+2+3) weeks = 620/10 = 62% overall
```

### 2. Velocity (% per week)
```
Calculation: Progress gained / Time elapsed

Example:
Started: March 1 (0% complete)
Current: March 29 (4 weeks later, 32% complete)

Velocity: 32% / 4 weeks = 8% per week
```

### 3. Projected Completion Date
```
Calculation: Current date + (Remaining progress / Velocity)

Example:
Current: 62% complete, Velocity: 8%/week
Remaining: 38%
Time needed: 38% / 8% per week = 4.75 weeks
Projected: Current date + 5 weeks
```

### 4. Schedule Variance (days ahead/behind)
```
Calculation: Expected progress vs Actual progress

Example:
Timeline: 12 weeks total
Elapsed: 4 weeks (33% of timeline)
Expected progress: 33%
Actual progress: 32%
Variance: 1% behind

At current pace: ~3 days behind schedule
```

### 5. Burn Rate (for budget-tracked goals)
```
Calculation: Budget spent vs Budget allocated vs Progress

Example:
Budget: $10,000
Spent: $4,500
Progress: 40%

Expected spend at 40%: $4,000
Actual spend: $4,500
Over by: $500 (12.5% over budget at this stage)
```

## Status Determination

### Red/Yellow/Green Framework

**ðŸŸ¢ Green (On Track)**:
- Progress >= 90% of expected
- Velocity >= 90% of required
- No critical blockers
- On or under budget

**ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (At Risk)**:
- Progress 70-89% of expected
- Velocity 70-89% of required
- Some blockers present
- Slightly over budget (<20%)

**ðŸ”´ Red (Off Track)**:
- Progress <70% of expected
- Velocity <70% of required
- Critical blockers
- Significantly over budget (>20%)

### Example Status Logic
```python
def determine_status(expected_progress, actual_progress, blockers):
    variance = (actual_progress / expected_progress) * 100

    if variance >= 90 and not critical_blockers(blockers):
        return "ðŸŸ¢ On Track"
    elif variance >= 70:
        return "ðŸŸ¡ At Risk"
    else:
        return "ðŸ”´ Off Track"
```

## Tracking Patterns

### Pattern 1: Percentage-Based Tracking
Best for milestones with clear deliverables.

```
Milestone: "Build user authentication"
Tasks:
- Login page: 25% weight
- Registration: 25% weight
- Password reset: 25% weight
- Session management: 25% weight

Progress:
- Login: Complete (25%)
- Registration: Complete (25%)
- Password reset: In progress (15%)
- Session: Not started (0%)

Milestone progress: 65%
```

### Pattern 2: Task Completion Tracking
Best for milestones with discrete tasks.

```
Milestone: "Content marketing campaign"
Tasks: 20 total

Completed: 12
In Progress: 3
Not Started: 5

Progress: 12/20 = 60%
(In progress tasks = 0% until complete for simplicity)
```

### Pattern 3: Time-Based Tracking
Best for research, learning, or time-boxed activities.

```
Milestone: "Complete certification course"
Planned: 40 hours total
Spent: 24 hours
Remaining: 16 hours

Progress: 24/40 = 60%

Note: Time spent â‰  value created, but useful proxy for effort-based goals
```

### Pattern 4: Outcome-Based Tracking
Best for results-oriented goals.

```
Milestone: "Acquire 100 new customers"
Target: 100
Current: 67
Remaining: 33

Progress: 67%
```

## Dashboard Components

### Minimal Viable Dashboard

**Must Have**:
1. Goal statement
2. Overall progress percentage
3. Milestone status table
4. Red/yellow/green indicator
5. Active blockers list
6. Last updated date

**Should Have**:
7. Velocity and trend
8. Projected completion date
9. Recent activity log
10. Next milestones preview

**Nice to Have**:
11. Progress chart/graph
12. Historical comparison
13. Resource utilization
14. Risk assessment

### Dashboard Template

```markdown
# Progress Dashboard
**Goal**: [Goal statement]
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´
**Last Updated**: [Date]

## Overall Progress: XX%
â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘

**Timeline**:
- Elapsed: [X] of [Y] weeks
- Remaining: [Z] weeks
- Projected completion: [Date]

**Velocity**: [A]% per week (expected: [B]%)

## Milestones

| Milestone | Progress | Status | Due | Risk |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----|------|
| M1 | 100% âœ“ | Done | Past | ðŸŸ¢ |
| M2 | 75% â‹¯ | In Progress | Week X | ðŸŸ¡ |
| M3 | 0% â—‹ | Not Started | Week Y | ðŸŸ¢ |

## Active Blockers
- [Blocker 1]: [Impact] - [Owner]
- [Blocker 2]: [Impact] - [Owner]

## Recent Activity (This Week)
- [Activity 1]
- [Activity 2]
- [Activity 3]

## Next Focus
- [What to work on next]
```

## Velocity Analysis

### Calculating Velocity Trend

```bash
# Simple moving average (last 4 weeks)
Week 1: 6% progress
Week 2: 8% progress
Week 3: 7% progress
Week 4: 9% progress

Average velocity: (6+8+7+9)/4 = 7.5% per week

Trend: â†‘ Improving (9% > 7.5% average)
```

### Interpreting Velocity

**Accelerating** (â†‘):
- Recent weeks faster than average
- Good sign: team hitting stride
- Action: Can we sustain? Any risks?

**Steady** (â†’):
- Consistent week-to-week
- Predictable progress
- Action: Monitor for changes

**Decelerating** (â†“):
- Recent weeks slower than average
- Warning sign: obstacles increasing
- Action: Investigate root cause

### Velocity-Based Forecasting

```
Current velocity: 7% per week
Remaining progress: 45%
Weeks needed: 45% / 7% = 6.4 weeks

If velocity improves to 9%: 45% / 9% = 5 weeks
If velocity drops to 5%: 45% / 5% = 9 weeks

Best case: 5 weeks early
Likely case: 6 weeks (on track)
Worst case: 3 weeks late
```

## Blocker Tracking

### Blocker Classification

**By Impact**:
- **High**: Blocks all progress on milestone
- **Medium**: Slows progress significantly
- **Low**: Minor inconvenience

**By Type**:
- **Dependency**: Waiting on external factor
- **Technical**: Problem with approach/implementation
- **Resource**: Missing people, budget, tools
- **Decision**: Needs stakeholder input

**By Age**:
- **New**: <3 days old
- **Active**: 3-7 days old
- **Stuck**: >7 days old (escalate!)

### Blocker Template

```markdown
## Active Blockers

### Blocker 1: [Name]
**Impact**: High/Medium/Low
**Type**: Dependency/Technical/Resource/Decision
**Age**: [X] days
**Owner**: [Person resolving]
**Status**: Open/In Progress/Resolved
**Blocking**: [Which milestone(s)]
**Description**: [What's blocked and why]
**Action**: [What's being done to resolve]
**ETA**: [When expected to resolve]
```

## Quick Reference

### Status at a Glance

```bash
# Quick check command
check_status() {
    PROGRESS=$(get_progress)
    EXPECTED=$(get_expected_progress)
    VARIANCE=$(calculate_variance)

    if [ $VARIANCE -ge 90 ]; then
        echo "ðŸŸ¢ On Track ($PROGRESS% complete)"
    elif [ $VARIANCE -ge 70 ]; then
        echo "ðŸŸ¡ At Risk ($PROGRESS% complete, ${VARIANCE}% of expected)"
    else
        echo "ðŸ”´ Off Track ($PROGRESS% complete, ${VARIANCE}% of expected)"
    fi
}
```

### Update Template

```bash
# Quick update format
@progress-tracker "[goal-id] M2 completed 75%, finished tasks A,B,C, blocked on API access"

Parsed:
- Milestone: M2
- Progress: 75%
- Activities: finished tasks A,B,C
- Blocker: blocked on API access
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Update frequently** - Weekly minimum, daily for fast-paced goals
2. **Keep it simple** - Track essential metrics only
3. **Be honest** - Accurate tracking enables good decisions
4. **Flag early** - Don't wait for red status to raise concerns
5. **Celebrate wins** - Note milestones completed, progress made
6. **Archive history** - Keep snapshots for trend analysis
7. **Make it visual** - Progress bars > numbers alone
8. **Review regularly** - Dashboard is input to reviews
9. **Act on signals** - Tracking without action is waste

This skill should be read before setting up or updating progress tracking for any goal.
