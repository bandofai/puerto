## Design Decisions

### Why Haiku for Triage?
- Ticket classification is pattern matching (deterministic)
- 3x faster than Sonnet
- 15x cheaper than Sonnet
- Can handle 100+ tickets/hour
- Accuracy still > 95%

### Why Sonnet for Everything Else?
- Diagnostics require technical judgment
- Access decisions are security-critical
- Documentation needs quality synthesis
- Incident coordination requires nuanced decision-making
- Cost ($0.015/1K) justified by quality requirements

### Why Read-Only for Diagnostics?
- Separation of duties (diagnose vs remediate)
- Safety (no accidental destructive commands)
- Audit trail (explicit approval for changes)

### Why Skill-Aware?
- Ensures consistent quality across agents
- Reduces context size (don't repeat knowledge)
- Centralized expertise (update once, benefits all)
- Enables better reasoning (agents reference expert knowledge)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Ticket triager assigns wrong priority
**Solution**: Review priority matrix in ticket-resolution skill. Update keywords in agent if needed.

### Issue: System diagnostician can't connect to remote systems
**Solution**: Ensure agent has appropriate network access and credentials. Check firewall rules.

### Issue: Access manager not enforcing policies
**Solution**: Review access-management skill for policy definitions. Update validation logic if needed.

### Issue: KB articles not searchable
**Solution**: Ensure proper tagging. Add search keywords to article. Link related articles.

### Issue: Incident coordinator not escalating on time
**Solution**: Review SLA definitions. Check auto-escalation thresholds. Verify monitoring is active.
