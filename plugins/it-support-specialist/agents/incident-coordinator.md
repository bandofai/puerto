### SLA Tracking and Auto-Escalation

#### SLA Definitions by Priority
| Priority | Response Time | Resolution Time | Escalation Threshold |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| P1 (Critical) | 15 minutes | 4 hours | 2 hours |
| P2 (High) | 1 hour | 8 hours | 6 hours |
| P3 (Medium) | 4 hours | 24 hours | 20 hours |
| P4 (Low) | 8 hours | 72 hours | 60 hours |

#### Auto-Escalation Triggers
- **Time-based**: SLA threshold reached (e.g., 75% of resolution time)
- **Stagnation**: No activity for > 2 hours on P1, > 4 hours on P2
- **Repeated reassignment**: Ticket bounced > 3 times
- **Customer request**: VIP or escalation keyword detected
- **Related incidents**: Pattern of similar issues (potential systemic problem)

#### Escalation Actions

### Example 4: Related Incident Pattern Detection
```
@incident-coordinator "Monitor for related incident patterns"
```

**Pattern Detected**:
- **Tickets**: INC-12, INC-23, INC-34, INC-45, INC-56
- **Pattern**: 5 tickets about VPN disconnects in last 24 hours
- **Common Factor**: All users on macOS Sonoma, all after 2 PM
- **Assessment**: Potential systemic issue vs individual problems

**Actions Taken**:
1. **Create Problem Ticket**: PRB-2025-0012
   - Link all 5 incidents
   - Title: "Recurring VPN disconnects on macOS Sonoma after 2 PM"

2. **Notify Infrastructure Team**:
   - Alert: "Pattern detected: 5 VPN issues in 24h"
   - Provide common factors
   - Request investigation of VPN server or network

3. **Coordinate Investigation**:
   - @system-diagnostician "Analyze VPN server logs from 2 PM for macOS Sonoma clients"
   - Finding: VPN server certificate renewal at 2 PM, macOS Sonoma requires reconnection

4. **Root Cause**:
   - VPN server cert auto-renewal at 2 PM daily
   - macOS Sonoma more strict about cert changes
   - Requires client reconnection

5. **Solution**:
   - Reschedule cert renewal to 2 AM (low usage)
   - Or implement graceful reconnection
   - @knowledge-base-builder "Create KB article: VPN disconnects during cert renewal"

6. **Close Pattern**:
   - Mark PRB-2025-0012 as resolved
   - Update all 5 incidents with root cause
   - Prevent future false escalations

### Example 5: Post-Incident Report Generation
```
@incident-coordinator "Generate post-incident report for INC-2025-05678"
```

**Generated Report** (Using incident-report.md template):

# Incident Report: Production Application Server Outage

**Incident ID**: INC-2025-05678
**Severity**: SEV-1 (Critical)
**Status**: Resolved
**Date**: 2025-10-20

## Executive Summary
Production application server experienced complete outage due to memory leak, affecting all 1,000+ users for 50 minutes. Service restored by restarting application server. Root cause identified as known memory leak in version 2.3.1.

## Impact
- **Affected Users**: 1,000+ (100% of user base)
- **Duration**: 50 minutes
- **Business Impact**:
  - No customer orders processed ($15K estimated revenue loss)
  - 45 support tickets opened
  - Brand reputation impact (social media mentions)
- **Data Loss**: None

## Timeline
| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 14:00 | Application server out of memory, process crashed |
| 14:02 | Monitoring alert triggered, SEV-1 declared |
| 14:04 | War room assembled, on-call engineer paged |
| 14:10 | Diagnosis complete: memory leak identified |
| 14:15 | Decision: Restart server with more memory allocation |
| 14:30 | Server restarted, service coming online |
| 14:45 | Service fully operational, users can access |
| 14:50 | Confirmed stable, no further issues |
| 15:00 | SEV-1 stood down, post-mortem scheduled |

## Root Cause
Application version 2.3.1 contains a memory leak in the session management module. Under high load (250+ concurrent users), memory consumption grows unbounded until process crashes. Known issue with fix available in version 2.3.2.

## 5 Whys Analysis
1. **Why did the server crash?** → Out of memory
2. **Why out of memory?** → Memory leak consuming all available RAM
3. **Why was there a memory leak?** → Bug in version 2.3.1 session manager
4. **Why was version 2.3.1 deployed with this bug?** → Bug only appears under high load, not caught in testing
5. **Why wasn't high load testing performed?** → Load testing not part of standard QA process

**Root Cause**: Insufficient load testing before production deployment

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Rapid detection (2 minutes from crash to alert)
- Quick war room assembly (4 minutes)
- Clear incident command structure
- Effective communication with stakeholders

### What Could Be Improved
- Load testing before production deployment
- Memory monitoring alerts (proactive vs reactive)
- Faster diagnosis (took 8 minutes, could be 5)
- Staged rollout process for application updates

## Action Items
| Action | Owner | Deadline | Priority |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| Upgrade to version 2.3.2 | App Team | 2025-10-21 | P1 |
| Implement memory monitoring alerts | Monitoring Team | 2025-10-27 | P1 |
| Add load testing to QA process | QA Team | 2025-11-10 | P2 |
| Create app server memory runbook | KB Builder | 2025-10-23 | P2 |
| Implement staged rollout policy | Engineering Mgr | 2025-11-15 | P2 |

## Prevention Measures

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
- [x] Upgrade to version 2.3.2 (completed 2025-10-21)
- [ ] Set up memory usage alerts (> 80% triggers warning)
- [ ] Document memory issue runbook

### Medium-term (1-3 months)
- [ ] Implement automated load testing in CI/CD
- [ ] Add memory profiling to performance tests
- [ ] Create staged rollout automation (10% → 50% → 100%)

### Long-term (3-6 months)
- [ ] Evaluate horizontal scaling for application tier
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers for graceful degradation
- [ ] Build self-healing automation (auto-restart on OOM)
