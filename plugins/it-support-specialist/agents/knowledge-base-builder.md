# Runbook: User Password Reset

**Document ID**: RB-2025-012
**Version**: 1.0
**Owner**: IT Support Team
**Difficulty**: Beginner
**Estimated Time**: 5 minutes

## Overview
Procedure to reset user password in Active Directory when user forgets password or account is locked.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Active Directory admin access
- [ ] PowerShell on domain controller
- [ ] User identity verified via secondary channel (phone, manager confirmation)
- [ ] Ticket number for audit trail

## When to Use
- User reports forgotten password
- Account locked due to failed login attempts
- User requested password reset for security reasons
- Compliance-required password change

## Before You Begin
**Important Notes**:
- ALWAYS verify user identity before resetting password
- Never share passwords over email or unencrypted channels
- Log all password resets for security audit

## Procedure

### Step 1: Verify User Identity
**Description**: Confirm you're speaking with the actual user

**Actions**:
1. Call user at phone number on file
2. Verify employee ID or ask security questions
3. Confirm manager name and department
4. Document verification method in ticket

**If verification fails**: Escalate to security team

### Step 2: Reset Password in Active Directory
**Description**: Generate and set new temporary password

**Commands**:
```powershell
# Reset password
$newPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText "TempPass$(Get-Random -Min 100 -Max 999)!" -Force
Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity "username" -Reset -NewPassword $newPassword
Set-ADUser -Identity "username" -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true

# Unlock account if locked
Unlock-ADAccount -Identity "username"
```

**Expected Output**: No errors, password reset successful

**If this fails**: Check if account is disabled or deleted

### Step 3: Communicate Password Securely
**Description**: Provide temporary password to user

**Actions**:
1. Read password to user over phone (do not email)
2. Spell out clearly to avoid confusion (O vs 0, 1 vs l)
3. Inform user they must change password on next login
4. Provide self-service password change link if available

### Step 4: Document in Ticket
**Description**: Record password reset for audit

**Actions**:
1. Update ticket with "Password reset completed"
2. Note verification method used
3. Note temporary password sent (do not include actual password)
4. Close ticket after user confirms access restored

## Verification
User can successfully login with temporary password and is prompted to create new password.

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Cannot reset password: Access denied"
**Cause**: Insufficient permissions
**Solution**: Request password reset admin role or escalate to senior admin

### Issue: User still cannot login after reset
**Cause**: Account may be disabled or expired
**Solution**: Check account status with `Get-ADUser -Identity username -Properties Enabled,AccountExpirationDate`
