4. Identify excessive permissions
5. Process approved removals
6. Document review for compliance

#### Automated Checks
- Detect accounts with no recent login (90 days)
- Flag users with conflicting roles (SOX)
- Identify orphaned accounts (no manager)
- Alert on policy violations

## Provisioning Commands by System

### Active Directory / LDAP
```powershell
# Create user
New-ADUser -Name "John Doe" -GivenName "John" -Surname "Doe" -SamAccountName "jdoe" -UserPrincipalName "john.doe@company.com" -EmailAddress "john.doe@company.com" -Enabled $true

# Add to group
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Engineering" -Members "jdoe"

# Reset password
Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity "jdoe" -Reset -NewPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText "TempPass123!" -Force)
Set-ADUser -Identity "jdoe" -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true

# Disable account
Disable-ADAccount -Identity "jdoe"
```

### Google Workspace
```bash
# Create user
gam create user john.doe@company.com firstname John lastname Doe password "TempPass123!" changepassword on

# Add to group
gam update group engineering@company.com add member john.doe@company.com

# Reset password
gam update user john.doe@company.com password "NewTempPass123!" changepassword on

# Suspend account
gam update user john.doe@company.com suspended on
```

### AWS IAM
```bash
# Create user
aws iam create-user --user-name john.doe

# Add to group
aws iam add-user-to-group --user-name john.doe --group-name Developers

# Create access key
aws iam create-access-key --user-name john.doe

aws iam delete-user --user-name john.doe
```

## Audit and Compliance

### Audit Log Requirements
- **Who**: User performing action
- **What**: Action taken (create, modify, delete, grant, revoke)
- **When**: Timestamp (UTC)
- **Where**: System or resource affected
- **Why**: Justification and approval
- **How**: Method (manual, automated, emergency)

### Compliance Reporting
- Access grant/revoke summary by time period
- Privilege escalation events
- Failed access requests
- Emergency access usage
- Access review completion status
- Policy violation incidents
- Stale account cleanup

## Safety Considerations

### Approval Requirements
- Standard access: Manager approval
- Elevated access: Manager + IT Director approval
- Admin access: IT Director + CISO approval
- Emergency access: On-call manager + post-review

### Separation of Duties
- Access manager cannot approve their own requests
- Segregation of duties rules enforced (SOX)
- No single person has complete system control

### Least Privilege
- Grant minimum necessary access
- Time-limited access when possible
- Regular access reviews to reduce privilege creep

## Performance Metrics
- Average provisioning time: 15-30 minutes for new user
- Password reset time: < 5 minutes
- Offboarding completion: < 2 hours
- Access review completion rate: > 95%
- Policy compliance rate: > 98%
- Cost per request: ~$0.05-0.10
