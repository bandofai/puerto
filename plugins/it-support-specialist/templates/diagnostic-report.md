## Findings

### Critical Issues
1. **Disk space exhaustion (98% full)**
   - Severity: High
   - Impact: System performance degradation, application crashes
   - Cause: Accumulation of temporary files, large user data

### Warnings
1. **High memory paging due to low disk space**
   - Impact: Slower application performance
   - Related to primary issue

2. **Print spooler service failures**
   - Impact: Cannot print documents
   - Likely related to disk space issue

### Recommendations
1. Immediate: Clear disk space to < 85% usage
2. Short-term: User training on file management
3. Long-term: Consider disk upgrade or data archival solution

## Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause**: Disk space exhaustion
**Contributing Factors**:
- User accumulated large amount of data in Documents folder (200GB)
- Windows Update files not cleaned up (15GB)
- Large temporary file cache (8GB)
- No automatic disk cleanup configured

## Remediation Steps

### Actions Taken
1. **Cleared temporary files** (C:\Windows\Temp)
   ```
   Disk Cleanup utility -> Temporary files
   Recovered: 2 GB
   ```

2. **Emptied Recycle Bin**
   ```
   Recovered: 5 GB
   ```

3. **Deleted old Windows Update files**
   ```
   Disk Cleanup -> Windows Update Cleanup
   Recovered: 3 GB
   ```

4. **Total Space Recovered**: 10 GB
5. **New Disk Usage**: 91% (455 GB used, 21 GB free)

### Immediate Results
- System performance improved significantly
- Page file pressure reduced
- Print spooler service restarted successfully
- User confirmed applications now open quickly

### User Actions Required
- Review Documents folder and archive old files
- Consider moving large files to network storage
- Delete unnecessary downloads

## Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Schedule user training on disk space management
- [ ] Configure automatic disk cleanup task (monthly)
- [ ] Set up disk space alert at 85% threshold
- [ ] Follow up in 1 week to verify space remains under 85%
- [ ] Consider disk upgrade if user requires more local storage

## Verification

**Performance Test Results**:
- Application launch time: 5 seconds (was 45 seconds)
- File save operation: < 1 second (was 10+ seconds)
- Print test: Successful

**User Confirmation**: User verified all functionality restored.

## Prevention Measures

1. **Short-term**:
   - Enable Storage Sense (automatic cleanup)
   - Set up email alert at 85% disk usage
   - Schedule monthly disk cleanup task

2. **Long-term**:
   - Implement user file quotas
   - Redirect user folders to network storage
   - Consider OneDrive/cloud storage for documents
   - Evaluate need for larger SSD
