## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Root Cause
Application version 2.3.1 contains a memory leak in the session management module. Under high load (250+ concurrent users), memory consumption grows unbounded at approximately 50MB per minute until the process exhausts available RAM and crashes.

### Contributing Factors
1. **Inadequate Testing**: Memory leak only manifests under high concurrent load, not caught in QA testing
2. **Insufficient Monitoring**: No proactive memory usage alerts configured (only reactive crash alerts)
3. **Deployment Process**: New version deployed to 100% of production without staged rollout
4. **Known Issue**: Memory leak was a known issue in version 2.3.1 with fix available in 2.3.2, but upgrade was scheduled for next maintenance window

### 5 Whys Analysis

1. **Why did the server crash?**
   ‚Üí Server ran out of memory and OOM killer terminated the process

2. **Why did it run out of memory?**
   ‚Üí Memory leak consuming all available RAM over several hours

3. **Why was there a memory leak?**
   ‚Üí Bug in version 2.3.1 session management module

4. **Why was buggy version deployed?**
   ‚Üí Memory leak only appears under high concurrent load (250+ users), not caught in testing

5. **Why wasn't high-load testing performed?**
   ‚Üí Load testing not part of standard QA process; test environment limited to 50 concurrent users

**Root Cause**: Insufficient load testing in QA process allowed memory leak to reach production

## Response Timeline (Detailed)

### Detection Phase (14:00 - 14:02)
**14:00** - Application server process terminated due to OOM condition
**14:01** - Users began reporting inability to access application

### Assessment and Mobilization (14:04 - 14:06)
**14:04** - Notification sent to:
  - Engineering leadership (CTO, VP Engineering)
  - Operations team (3 engineers)
  - Customer support leadership
  - Communications team

**14:05** - Initial assessment:

**14:09** - Correlated with known issue: Version 2.3.1 memory leak under high load
**14:10** - **Root cause confirmed**: Memory leak in version 2.3.1

### Decision Making (14:10 - 14:15)
**14:10** - Options discussed:
  1. Restart server (fast, temporary fix)
  2. Roll back to version 2.3.0 (slower, stable)
  3. Upgrade to version 2.3.2 with fix (slowest, permanent)

**14:12** - Decision matrix evaluated:
  | Option | Time | Risk | Durability |
  |--------|------|------|------------|
  | Restart | 10 min | Medium (may recur) | Temporary |
  | Rollback | 30 min | Low | Stable |
  | Upgrade | 45 min | Low | Permanent |

**14:15** - **Decision**: Restart server immediately to restore service quickly, then upgrade to 2.3.2 during next maintenance window

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ‚úÖ
1. **Fast Detection**: Monitoring alert triggered within 2 minutes of failure
2. **Rapid Mobilization**: War room assembled in 4 minutes
3. **Clear Leadership**: Incident Commander role well-defined, decisions made quickly
4. **Good Communication**: Regular status updates to stakeholders every 15 minutes
5. **Effective Diagnosis**: Root cause identified in 10 minutes
6. **Clean Handoffs**: Responsibilities clearly assigned, no confusion

### What Could Be Improved üîß
1. **Prevention**: Memory leak should have been caught before production
2. **Proactive Monitoring**: Should have had memory usage alerts to catch issue before crash
3. **Staged Rollout**: Should have deployed to 10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100% instead of all at once
4. **Testing**: Load testing should be mandatory for all production deployments
5. **Runbook**: No runbook existed for OOM recovery, team had to improvise
6. **Customer Comms**: First customer communication took 20 minutes (should be < 10 minutes)

### Surprises / Unexpected Findings ü§î
1. Memory leak rate was faster than expected (50MB/min vs documented 20MB/min)
2. Monitoring system struggled with flood of alerts (600+ alerts in 2 minutes)
3. Some users remained logged in despite outage (cached credentials)
4. Support ticket flood was smaller than expected (users gave up vs opening tickets)
