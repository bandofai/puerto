# Chore Scheduler Plugin

Household chore coordination and task distribution manager with fair rotation, completion tracking, and accountability.

## Overview

The Chore Scheduler plugin helps households manage chores fairly and efficiently through:
- **Fair rotation systems** (weekly, monthly, seasonal)
- **Completion tracking** with accountability
- **Workload balancing** to prevent resentment
- **Automated reminders** and escalation
- **Analytics** on completion rates and fairness

## Agents

### 1. rotation-planner (Haiku - Fast & Cost-Effective)

Creates fair, balanced chore rotation schedules.

**Use when**:
- Setting up new household chore system
- Creating weekly or monthly rotation schedules
- Rebalancing workload distribution
- Adding/removing household members

**Capabilities**:
- Equal time distribution (±10% variance)
- Task variety rotation (prevents monotony)
- Constraint handling (physical limitations, preferences)
- Multi-cycle planning (4+ weeks ahead)

**Example**:
```
Use rotation-planner to create weekly rotation for 3 people:
- Alice, Bob, Charlie
- Include: kitchen cleanup (daily), vacuum (weekly), bathroom (weekly),
  laundry (weekly), trash (weekly)
- Alice prefers kitchen tasks, Bob can't do heavy lifting
```

**Output**: `data/rotations/rotation-{date}.json` with 4-week rotation plan

### 2. task-tracker (Haiku - Fast & Cost-Effective)

Tracks chore completion and sends reminders.

**Use when**:
- Marking tasks complete
- Checking what's due today
- Finding overdue tasks
- Generating reminders for household members

**Capabilities**:
- Real-time completion tracking
- Overdue task detection (>24 hours past due)
- Completion rate calculation per person
- Streak tracking (gamification)
- Friendly reminder generation

**Example**:
```
Use task-tracker to:
1. Mark "Kitchen Cleanup" complete by Alice
2. Check what tasks are due today
3. Find any overdue tasks and send reminders
```

**Output**: Status summary with completion rates and reminder messages

### 3. fairness-analyzer (Sonnet - Requires Judgment)

Analyzes workload distribution and identifies imbalances.

**Use when**:
- Monthly or bi-weekly fairness review
- Someone complains about workload
- Completion rates are low
- Need to rebalance rotation

**Capabilities**:
- Multi-dimensional fairness analysis (time, variety, difficulty, completion)
- Root cause identification for imbalances

- Trend analysis (requires 3+ months of data)
- Conflict resolution support

**Example**:
```
Use fairness-analyzer to review last 4 weeks of chore data.
Alice feels she's doing more than Bob and Charlie.
Analyze workload and completion rates.
```

**Output**: Comprehensive fairness report with recommendations and proposed new rotation

   - Note any constraints

2. Save rotation to data/rotations/

3. Share with household for feedback

4. Adjust if needed and finalize
```

### Daily/Weekly Operations

```
1. Use task-tracker to check what's due today:
   "What chores are due today?"

2. Mark tasks complete as they're done:
   "Mark Kitchen Cleanup complete by Alice"

3. Send reminders for pending tasks:
   "Generate reminders for today's pending chores"

4. Check for overdue tasks:
   "Find overdue tasks and escalate"
```

### Monthly Review

```
1. Use fairness-analyzer for monthly review:
   "Analyze chore fairness for the past 4 weeks"

2. Review findings with household:
   - Workload balance
   - Completion rates
   - Issues identified

3. If rebalancing needed:
   "Use rotation-planner to implement recommended changes"

4. Update rotation and reset tracking
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
- Begin with 5-7 core chores
- Add more as system stabilizes
- Don't overwhelm household initially

### 2. Review Regularly
- Weekly: Check completion rates
- Monthly: Run fairness analysis
- Quarterly: Redesign rotation if needed

### 3. Be Flexible
- Allow task swaps with notice
- Accommodate special situations (illness, travel)
- Adjust schedules based on feedback

### 4. Keep It Positive
- Praise completion more than criticize missed tasks
- Celebrate perfect weeks
- Make it fun with gamification

### 5. Define Quality Standards
- Document what "done" means for each task
- Avoid perfectionism (good enough is good enough)
- Consistent expectations for everyone

### 6. Handle Conflicts Constructively
- Use data from fairness-analyzer
- Listen to complaints without judgment
- Propose solutions, get agreement
- Follow up in 2 weeks

## Metrics to Track

**Overall Health**:
- Completion rate (target: >85%)
- Overdue rate (target: <5%)
- Workload variance (target: <15%)

**Individual Performance**:
- Completion rate per person (target: >80%)
- Average time to complete
- Streak tracking
- Preferred vs disliked tasks

**System Effectiveness**:
- Task rotation variety (target: 3+ categories per person)
- Adjustment frequency (stable system = fewer adjustments)
- Household satisfaction (survey monthly)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tasks consistently overdue

**Causes**:
- Unrealistic time estimates
- Poor scheduling (conflicts with work/school)
- Task too difficult for assigned person
- Low motivation

**Solutions**:
- Use task-tracker to analyze actual completion times
- Reschedule tasks to better times
- Swap difficult tasks for easier ones
- Add accountability or rewards

### Issue: One person feels overworked

**Causes**:
- Actually unbalanced (bad rotation design)
- Perception issue (feels unfair even when balanced)
- Others not completing their tasks

**Solutions**:
- Use fairness-analyzer to get objective data
- If truly unbalanced, use rotation-planner to rebalance
- If perception, show data and explain fairness
- If others not completing, address accountability

### Issue: Low completion rates across household

**Causes**:
- Too many tasks (system overload)
- Tasks too difficult or time-consuming
- Poor accountability
- Life circumstances changed

**Solutions**:
- Reduce total number of tasks
- Break large tasks into smaller ones
- Implement accountability system (rewards/consequences)
- Reassess household capacity and adjust

### Issue: Frequent rotation changes

**Causes**:
- Initial rotation poorly designed
- Household dynamics changed
- Tasks not well-defined

**Solutions**:
- Use rotation-planner with all constraints documented
- Involve household in planning process
- Define tasks clearly with examples
- Allow 4-week trial before changing

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: New Household Setup

```
Step 1: Gather requirements
- 3 adults: Alice, Bob, Charlie
- Core chores: Kitchen (daily), Vacuum (weekly), Bathroom (weekly),
  Laundry (weekly), Trash (weekly)
- Constraints: Alice prefers kitchen, Bob has back problems

Step 2: Create rotation
@rotation-planner "Create weekly rotation for 3 people with constraints..."

Step 3: Review and adjust
- Check workload balance (should be 100-120 min/week per person)
- Verify task variety (each person gets 2-3 different types)
- Confirm no impossible assignments

Step 4: Launch system
- Save rotation to data/rotations/
- Share with household
- Set up reminder system
- Schedule first fairness review (in 4 weeks)
```

### Example 2: Monthly Fairness Review

```
Step 1: Analyze data
@fairness-analyzer "Review last 4 weeks of chore completion"

Step 2: Review findings
- Completion rates: Alice 92%, Bob 85%, Charlie 78%
- Workload: Alice 125 min/week, Bob 118 min/week, Charlie 95 min/week
- Issues: Charlie under target and low completion rate

Step 3: Discuss with household
- Share analysis report (non-judgmental)
- Ask Charlie about barriers
- Identify root cause (schedule conflict on weekends)

Step 4: Implement solution
@rotation-planner "Adjust rotation to move Charlie's tasks to weekdays"

Step 5: Monitor
- Track for 2 weeks
- Re-analyze to verify improvement
```

### Example 3: Daily Operations

```
Morning routine:
@task-tracker "What chores are due today?"

Output:
- Kitchen Cleanup (daily) → Alice
- Take Out Trash (Tuesday) → Bob

Evening check:
@task-tracker "Mark Kitchen Cleanup complete by Alice at 7:30pm"
@task-tracker "Check for pending or overdue tasks"

Output:
- Trash duty still pending (due by 9pm) - reminder sent to Bob
```
