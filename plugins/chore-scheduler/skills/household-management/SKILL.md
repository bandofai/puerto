# Household Management Skill

Production-tested patterns for chore rotation, task distribution, and completion tracking.

## Chore Rotation Patterns

### Fair Distribution Algorithms

**Equal Time Method**:
```
1. Calculate total household chore time
2. Divide by number of members
3. Target time per person = Total / Members
4. Assign tasks until each person reaches target ±10%
```

**Round Robin Method**:
```
1. List all chores in random order
2. Take turns selecting (A → B → C → A → B → C)
3. Continue until all assigned
4. Recalculate if time variance >15%
```

**Category Balancing Method**:
```
1. Group tasks by category (kitchen, cleaning, outdoor, etc.)
2. Ensure each person gets tasks from multiple categories
3. Balance time within each category
4. Rotate categories weekly/monthly
```

### Rotation Cycles

**Daily Rotation** (quick tasks):
- Kitchen cleanup after meals
- Trash duty
- Pet care
- Dish loading/unloading

**Weekly Rotation** (moderate tasks):
- Vacuum/mop floors
- Bathroom cleaning
- Laundry
- Grocery shopping

**Monthly Rotation** (deep cleaning):
- Window washing
- Oven/fridge deep clean
- Organize closets
- Seasonal tasks

**Quarterly Rotation** (maintenance):
- HVAC filter change
- Gutter cleaning
- Garage organization
- Outdoor maintenance

### Task Categorization

**By Difficulty**:
- Level 1 (Easy): 5-10 min, low effort (e.g., take out trash)
- Level 2 (Moderate): 15-30 min, medium effort (e.g., vacuum)
- Level 3 (Hard): 30-60 min, high effort (e.g., bathroom deep clean)
- Level 4 (Very Hard): 60+ min, very high effort (e.g., organize garage)

**By Frequency**:
- Daily: Every day (7x/week)
- Weekday: Mon-Fri (5x/week)
- Weekly: Once per week
- Biweekly: Every 2 weeks
- Monthly: Once per month

**By Type**:
- Kitchen: Cooking, dishes, cleanup, appliances
- Cleaning: Vacuum, mop, dust, windows
- Bathroom: Toilet, shower, sink, floors
- Laundry: Wash, dry, fold, put away
- Outdoor: Lawn, garden, trash bins, driveway
- Organization: Declutter, file, arrange
- Pets: Feed, walk, groom, vet
- Maintenance: Repairs, filters, checks

## Task Time Estimation

**Standard Times** (adjust for your household):

Kitchen:
- Dishes (hand wash): 15 min
- Load dishwasher: 5 min
- Unload dishwasher: 5 min
- Wipe counters: 5 min
- Sweep floor: 5 min
- Mop floor: 15 min
- Clean stove/oven: 20 min
- Clean fridge: 30 min

Cleaning:
- Vacuum room (100 sq ft): 5 min
- Mop room (100 sq ft): 8 min
- Dust surfaces: 10 min
- Clean windows (per window): 5 min
- Make bed: 2 min
- Change sheets: 10 min

Bathroom:
- Quick clean: 10 min
- Deep clean: 30 min
- Toilet only: 5 min
- Shower/tub: 15 min

Laundry:
- Load washing machine: 3 min
- Transfer to dryer: 3 min
- Fold clothes: 15 min
- Put away clothes: 10 min
- Iron (if needed): +20 min

Outdoor:
- Mow lawn (1000 sq ft): 20 min
- Rake leaves: 30 min
- Water plants: 10 min
- Take out trash: 3 min
- Bring in trash bins: 2 min

## Fairness Principles

### Equity Not Equality

**Equality**: Everyone does the same tasks
- May not account for abilities, preferences, schedules

**Equity**: Everyone contributes fairly
- Accounts for physical limitations
- Considers work schedules
- Respects preferences (within reason)
- Balances liked/disliked tasks

### Workload Balancing

**Target**: 1.5-2.5 hours per person per week
**Acceptable variance**: ±15% (prevents resentment)
**Red flag**: >30% variance (immediate rebalancing needed)

**Calculation**:
```python
total_time = sum(task.estimated_minutes for all tasks)
target_per_person = total_time / num_members
variance = (person_time - target_per_person) / target_per_person * 100

if variance > 30:
    rebalance_immediately()
elif variance > 15:
    schedule_rebalancing_discussion()
```

### Task Variety

**Avoid**: One person always doing the same type
**Goal**: Each person experiences different task types

**Rotation Strategy**:
```
Week 1: Alice (kitchen), Bob (cleaning), Charlie (outdoor)
Week 2: Alice (cleaning), Bob (outdoor), Charlie (kitchen)
Week 3: Alice (outdoor), Bob (kitchen), Charlie (cleaning)
Week 4: Repeat from Week 1
```

Benefits:
- Prevents boredom
- Cross-training (everyone can do everything)
- Appreciation for others' work
- Flexibility when someone is absent

### Preference Integration

**Data collection**:
```
Survey each member:
- Top 3 preferred tasks
- Top 3 disliked tasks
- Tasks physically unable to do
- Time availability patterns
```

**Application**:
- Give each person 1 preferred task (if possible)
- Rotate disliked tasks fairly
- Never assign impossible tasks
- Schedule tasks during available times

## Completion Tracking

### Accountability Systems

**Self-Reporting** (honor system):
- Member marks task complete
- Works well for mature households
- Risk: Tasks marked but not done

**Visual Tracking** (chore chart):
- Physical chart on fridge
- Check boxes when done
- Everyone can see status
- Good for families with kids

**App-Based** (automated):
- Notifications when tasks due
- Easy completion marking
- Historical tracking
- Analytics on completion rates

**Verification** (quality control):
- Random spot checks
- Weekly quality review
- Consequences for incomplete work
- Positive reinforcement for good work

### Reminder Strategies

**Timing**:
- Morning reminder (for tasks due that day)
- Evening reminder (if task still pending)
- Day-before reminder (for prep tasks)

**Tone** (progressive):
1. Friendly nudge: "Hey! Kitchen cleanup is on your list today 😊"
2. Gentle reminder: "Reminder: Kitchen cleanup is due by 9pm tonight"
3. Urgent notice: "Kitchen cleanup is overdue. Please complete ASAP."

**Frequency**:
- Don't nag (max 2 reminders/day)
- Escalate to household discussion if repeatedly ignored
- Adjust schedule if task is consistently overdue

### Streak Tracking

**Positive reinforcement**:
```
Current Streak: Alice - 12 days
Longest Streak: Bob - 21 days
Perfect Week: Charlie - 3 weeks in a row
```

**Benefits**:
- Gamification (makes chores fun)
- Motivation to maintain streak
- Visible progress
- Friendly competition

**Implementation**:
```python
if task_completed_on_time:
    streak += 1
    if streak % 7 == 0:  # Weekly milestone
        celebrate("You've completed a perfect week!")
    if streak > longest_streak:
        longest_streak = streak
        celebrate("New personal record!")
else:
    streak = 0  # Reset on missed task
```

## Overdue Task Escalation

**Level 1** (0-24 hours overdue):
- Send reminder
- Ask if help needed

**Level 2** (24-48 hours overdue):
- Household notification
- Offer to swap/help
- Document incident

**Level 3** (48+ hours overdue):
- Mandatory household discussion
- Understand root cause
- Adjust rotation if needed
- Reassign if emergency

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Time constraint (schedule conflict)?
- Difficulty too high (physical limitation)?
- Forgotten (need better reminders)?
- Resistance (disliked task)?
- Legitimately impossible (sick, traveling)?

**Solutions**:
- Reschedule task to better time
- Swap for easier task
- Increase reminder frequency
- Pair disliked task with preferred one
- Temporary coverage by others

## Seasonal Adjustments

**Summer**:
- Add: Lawn mowing, garden watering, pool cleaning
- Increase: Outdoor maintenance frequency
- Reduce: Indoor time (people outside more)

**Fall**:
- Add: Leaf raking, gutter cleaning
- Increase: Meal prep (back to school)
- Adjust: Earlier daylight = reschedule outdoor tasks

**Winter**:
- Add: Snow shoveling, sidewalk salting
- Increase: Indoor cleaning (more time inside)
- Reduce: Outdoor tasks (weather-dependent)

**Spring**:
- Add: Spring cleaning, window washing, yard prep
- Increase: Decluttering, organization
- Reset: Deep clean entire house

## Special Situations

### New Member Onboarding

**Week 1** (Observation):
- Shadow others doing tasks
- Learn household standards
- Ask questions

**Week 2-3** (Light Duty):
- Assign 2-3 easy tasks
- Provide guidance and feedback
- Adjust based on capability

**Week 4+** (Full Integration):
- Add to normal rotation
- Equal workload distribution
- Full accountability

### Member Temporarily Absent

**Short-term** (1-2 weeks):
- Redistribute tasks temporarily
- Track for rebalancing upon return
- No permanent rotation change

**Long-term** (1+ months):
- Create new rotation without person
- Rebalance when they return
- Consider adding extra help if needed

### Conflict Resolution

**Common Conflicts**:
1. "I do more than everyone else"
   - Solution: Show fairness analysis, adjust if true

2. "This task is too hard for me"
   - Solution: Swap for equivalent time task

3. "I don't have time"
   - Solution: Schedule analysis, find better times

4. "I always get the worst tasks"
   - Solution: Rotate disliked tasks fairly

5. "They don't do tasks properly"
   - Solution: Define quality standards, training

**Resolution Process**:
1. Listen to complaint without judgment
2. Gather data (completion rates, times, etc.)
3. Present facts objectively
4. Propose solution
5. Get agreement
6. Implement and monitor
7. Follow up in 2 weeks

## Quality Standards

**Completion Criteria**:

Kitchen:
- Counters wiped clean (no crumbs)
- Sink empty and rinsed
- Floor swept (no visible debris)
- Appliances wiped down

Bathroom:
- Toilet cleaned inside and out
- Sink/counter wiped clean
- Mirror streak-free
- Floor swept/mopped

Vacuum/Mop:
- All visible floor area covered
- Furniture moved if possible
- Corners and edges done
- No streaks on mopped floors

Laundry:
- Clothes washed and dried completely
- Folded neatly (not wrinkled)
- Put away in correct locations
- No clothes left in washer/dryer

## Motivation and Rewards

**Intrinsic Motivation**:
- Pride in clean home
- Contribution to family
- Learning life skills
- Autonomy and responsibility

**Extrinsic Motivation**:
- Allowance tied to completion
- Privileges (screen time, activities)
- Family rewards (if everyone completes, movie night)
- Leaderboard/competition

**Positive Reinforcement**:
- Verbal praise (specific, not generic)
- Extra privileges for streaks
- Household celebration for perfect months
- Recognition in family meetings

## Metrics and Analytics

**Track These KPIs**:

1. **Overall Completion Rate**
   - Target: >85%
   - Calculate: Completed tasks / Total tasks * 100

2. **Individual Completion Rates**
   - Target: >80% per person
   - Identify who needs support

3. **Average Time to Complete**
   - Compare estimated vs actual
   - Adjust estimates for accuracy

4. **Overdue Task Rate**
   - Target: <5%
   - Indicator of scheduling issues

5. **Workload Balance**
   - Target: <15% variance
   - Fairness metric

6. **Task Rotation Variety**
   - Target: Each person does 3+ task types
   - Prevents monotony

**Monthly Review**:
```
January 2025 Chore Report

Overall Completion: 87% ✅
- Alice: 92%
- Bob: 85%
- Charlie: 83%

Overdue Rate: 3% ✅

Workload Balance: 8% variance ✅
- Alice: 125 min/week
- Bob: 118 min/week
- Charlie: 115 min/week

Top Issues:
1. Bathroom cleaning often runs late (30% overdue)
2. Charlie's streak broke due to illness (excused)

Recommendations:
1. Reschedule bathroom from Sunday to Saturday
2. None needed - healthy status
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**:
   - Begin with 5-7 core tasks
   - Add more as system stabilizes
   - Don't overwhelm initially

2. **Be Consistent**:
   - Same rotation pattern
   - Predictable schedules
   - Regular reviews (monthly)

3. **Communicate Clearly**:
   - Everyone knows their tasks
   - Expectations are documented
   - Changes announced in advance

4. **Be Flexible**:
   - Life happens, adjust as needed
   - Allow task swaps with notice
   - Accommodate special situations

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Monthly fairness analysis
   - Quarterly rotation redesign
   - Annual household chore review

6. **Keep It Positive**:
   - Praise more than criticize
   - Celebrate successes
   - Make it fun (if possible)

7. **Document Everything**:
   - Standards for each task
   - Time estimates
   - Completion history
   - Adjustments and why

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Perfectionism**: Tasks done to "good enough" standard, not perfect
❌ **Micromanaging**: Let people do tasks their way (if result is same)
❌ **Overloading**: Keep total time reasonable (<3 hours/week per person)
❌ **Ignoring Feedback**: Listen when someone says task is too hard/wrong time
❌ **Inconsistent Standards**: Same quality expectations for everyone
❌ **Forgetting Appreciation**: Thank people for their contributions
