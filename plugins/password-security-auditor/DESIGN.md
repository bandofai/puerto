# Password & Security Auditor Plugin - Design Document

## Overview

A comprehensive security auditing plugin for Puerto that analyzes password strength, monitors breach exposure, tracks 2FA implementation, and provides actionable security recommendations - all without storing actual passwords.

## Architecture

### Agent System (3 Specialized Agents)

```
User Request
    ↓
security-auditor (coordinator)
    ├─ Analyzes password metadata
    ├─ Calculates security scores
    ├─ Delegates to specialists:
    │   ├─ breach-monitor
    │   └─ 2fa-tracker
    └─ Generates audit reports

Results aggregated → Comprehensive security assessment
```

### Agent Breakdown

#### 1. security-auditor (Coordinator)

- **Responsibilities**:
  - 2FA status tracking across accounts
  - Gap identification by priority
  - Setup guide generation
  - Authentication method comparison
  - Recovery option monitoring
  - Coverage compliance tracking

### Skill Library

**security-auditing** (shared knowledge base):
- Password strength algorithms (entropy calculation)

```

### Account Data Model

```json
{
  "service": "Gmail",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "priority": "critical",

  "password_metadata": {
    "length": 18,
    "entropy_bits": 95.2,
    "has_symbols": true,
    "has_patterns": false
  },

  "password_last_changed": "2024-10-15T10:30:00Z",

    "has_recovery_codes": true
  },

  "breach_exposure": {
    "found_in_breaches": 0,
    "last_checked": "2025-01-15T14:22:00Z"
  },

  "security_score": 92
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Privacy-Preserving Analysis

**Never Stores Passwords**:
- Analyzes password characteristics only
- User provides metadata (length, character types)
- Calculates entropy from metadata
- Detects patterns without seeing password

**K-Anonymity for Breach Checks**:
- Only first 5 chars of SHA-1 hash sent to API
- API returns all matching hashes
- Local verification of full hash match

### 2. Comprehensive Breach Monitoring

**Have I Been Pwned Integration**:
- Email breach checking
- Password hash verification
- Automatic severity classification
- Specific remediation guidance
- Historical tracking

**Breach Response**:
- Critical: Password exposed → immediate rotation
- High: Email exposed → phishing monitoring
- Medium: Account data → enable 2FA
- Low: General data → monitor account

### 3. 2FA Coverage Tracking

**Priority-Based Recommendations**:
- Critical accounts: Hardware key or TOTP required
- High priority: TOTP minimum
- Medium: Any 2FA acceptable
- Low: Optional

**Method Comparison**:
- Security scoring (Hardware > TOTP > Biometric > Email > SMS)
- Usability assessment
- Cost analysis
- Setup guides for each method

### 4. Intelligent Risk Scoring

**Multi-Factor Risk Calculation** (0-100):
- Password strength (entropy, patterns, age)
- Authentication methods (2FA presence/quality)
- Breach exposure (count and severity)
- Account priority (critical accounts weighted higher)

**Risk Levels**:
- 70+: Critical (immediate action)
- 50-69: High (this week)
- 30-49: Medium (this month)
- 0-29: Low (next quarter)

### 5. Compliance Alignment

**Standards Coverage**:
- NIST SP 800-63B (password guidelines)
- OWASP recommendations
- Industry best practices
- Configurable internal policies

## Model Recommendations

### Why These Choices?

**security-auditor: Sonnet**
- Requires strategic thinking for risk assessment
- Needs judgment for prioritization
- Coordinates multiple data sources
- Generates nuanced recommendations

**breach-monitor: Haiku**
- Deterministic API calls (no creativity needed)
- Fast response for breach checks
- Straightforward data parsing
- Pattern-based classification
- Cost-effective for frequent checks

**2fa-tracker: Haiku**
- Simple tracking and reporting
- Binary status checks (has 2FA or not)
- Template-based setup guides
- Quick gap identification
- Cost-effective for regular monitoring

## Security & Privacy

### Core Principles

1. **Never Store Passwords**: Only metadata and characteristics
2. **Local Storage Only**: All data in `~/.security-audit/`
3. **Privacy-Preserving APIs**: K-anonymity for password checks
4. **Encrypted Sensitive Data**: Recovery info uses Fernet encryption
5. **Audit Logging**: Track all security operations
6. **User Control**: Easy data export and deletion

### API Key Management

**Have I Been Pwned API**:
- Free tier: 1 request per 1.5 seconds
- API key required for automated checks
- Stored in config.json (user-controlled)
- Optional: Users can skip breach monitoring if preferred

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Times

- **Security Audit**: 30-60 seconds (includes API calls)
- **Breach Check**: ~2 seconds per email (rate limited)
- **2FA Review**: 5-10 seconds (local data)
- **Password Analysis**: < 1 second (metadata only)

### Token Usage

- **Full Audit**: ~8K tokens (Sonnet)
- **Breach Check**: ~2K tokens (Haiku)
- **2FA Review**: ~2K tokens (Haiku)

**Cost Optimization**: Using Haiku for specialists reduces cost by ~90% vs all Sonnet

## Comparison with Alternatives

### vs Manual Security Management

| Aspect | Manual | This Plugin |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Breach Monitoring | Reactive | Proactive |
| 2FA Tracking | Spreadsheet/Memory | Automated |
| Password Strength | Guesswork | Scientific (entropy) |
| Compliance | Manual review | Automated checks |
| Audit Frequency | Rarely | Scheduled |
| Remediation | Generic advice | Specific steps |

### vs Password Managers

**Complementary, Not Competitive**:
- Password managers: Store/generate passwords
- This plugin: Audit security posture
- Together: Complete security solution

**This plugin adds**:
- Breach monitoring across all accounts
- 2FA coverage tracking
- Compliance verification
- Security trend analysis

## Design Rationale

### Why 3 Agents vs 1 Monolithic?

**Benefits of Separation**:
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent has clear focus
2. **Model Optimization**: Use Haiku for simple tasks (cost savings)
3. **Parallel Execution**: Can check breaches + 2FA simultaneously
4. **Testability**: Each agent independently testable
5. **Maintainability**: Update breach monitoring without touching 2FA logic

### Why Skill-Based?

**Shared Knowledge Base**:
- Consistent security standards across agents
- Easy updates (update skill, all agents benefit)
- Educational value (users can read skill)
- Compliance documentation in one place

### Why Local Storage?

**Privacy & Control**:
- No cloud dependencies (except HIBP API)
- User owns all data
- No subscription required
- Easy backup/migration
- Audit trail preserved

## Summary

**Password & Security Auditor** provides comprehensive security analysis through three specialized agents, a shared knowledge base, and privacy-preserving techniques. It identifies risks, monitors breaches, tracks authentication, and delivers actionable recommendations - all while never storing actual passwords.

**Core Value**: Transform security from reactive to proactive with automated monitoring, intelligent analysis, and clear guidance.
