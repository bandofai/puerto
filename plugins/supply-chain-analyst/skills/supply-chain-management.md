## Demand Forecasting

Demand forecasting is the foundation of effective supply chain planning. Accurate forecasts enable optimal inventory levels, production schedules, and resource allocation.

### Moving Average Method

The moving average smooths out short-term fluctuations to identify trends.

**Formula**:
```
Simple Moving Average (SMA) = Sum of last n periods / n
```

**Example - 3-Month Moving Average**:

| Month | Actual Demand | 3-Month MA |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Jan   | 150           | -          |
| Feb   | 165           | -          |
| Mar   | 180           | -          |
| Apr   | 175           | 165        |
| May   | 190           | 173        |
| Jun   | 185           | 182        |

**Calculation for April**:
```
MA_April = (150 + 165 + 180) / 3 = 165
```

**Weighted Moving Average (WMA)**:
```
WMA = (w₁ × D₁ + w₂ × D₂ + w₃ × D₃) / (w₁ + w₂ + w₃)
```

Where weights (w) are assigned with more recent periods receiving higher weights.

**Example - Weighted 3-Month Average**:
- Most recent month: weight = 3
- Middle month: weight = 2
- Oldest month: weight = 1

```
WMA_April = (3 × 180 + 2 × 165 + 1 × 150) / 6
         = (540 + 330 + 150) / 6
         = 170
```

**When to Use**:
- Stable demand patterns
- Short-term forecasting (1-3 months)
- Quick response to recent changes (WMA)

**Limitations**:
- Lags behind actual trend
- Requires n periods of data before forecasting
- Poor for seasonal or trending data

### Exponential Smoothing

Exponential smoothing gives more weight to recent observations while maintaining all historical data.

**Formula**:
```
F_t+1 = α × D_t + (1 - α) × F_t
```

Where:
- F_t+1 = Forecast for next period
- D_t = Actual demand in current period
- F_t = Forecast for current period
- α = Smoothing constant (0 < α < 1)

**Alpha (α) Selection Guide**:
- α = 0.1 to 0.3: Stable demand, slow response
- α = 0.4 to 0.6: Moderate changes
- α = 0.7 to 0.9: Volatile demand, fast response

**Example - Exponential Smoothing (α = 0.3)**:

| Month | Actual | Forecast | Calculation |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Jan   | 150    | 150      | Initial     |
| Feb   | 165    | 150      | -           |
| Mar   | 180    | 154.5    | 0.3(165) + 0.7(150) |
| Apr   | 175    | 162.2    | 0.3(180) + 0.7(154.5) |
| May   | 190    | 166.0    | 0.3(175) + 0.7(162.2) |

**March Calculation**:
```
F_Mar = 0.3 × 165 + 0.7 × 150
      = 49.5 + 105
      = 154.5
```

### Double Exponential Smoothing (Holt's Method)

For data with trends, use double exponential smoothing.

**Formulas**:
```
Level: L_t = α × D_t + (1 - α) × (L_t-1 + T_t-1)
Trend: T_t = β × (L_t - L_t-1) + (1 - β) × T_t-1
Forecast: F_t+m = L_t + m × T_t
```

Where:
- L_t = Level at time t
- T_t = Trend at time t
- α = Level smoothing constant
- β = Trend smoothing constant
- m = Number of periods ahead

**Example Parameters**:
- α = 0.3 (level smoothing)
- β = 0.2 (trend smoothing)

### Seasonality Adjustment

Seasonal patterns repeat at regular intervals (quarterly, monthly, weekly).

**Seasonal Index Method**:

**Step 1: Calculate Average Demand**
```
Average Demand = Total Demand / Number of Periods
```

**Step 2: Calculate Seasonal Index**
```
Seasonal Index = Average Demand for Season / Overall Average
```

**Step 3: Deseasonalize Data**
```
Deseasonalized Demand = Actual Demand / Seasonal Index
```

**Step 4: Forecast Deseasonalized Demand**
Use moving average or exponential smoothing on deseasonalized data.

**Step 5: Reseasonalize Forecast**
```
Final Forecast = Deseasonalized Forecast × Seasonal Index
```

**Example - Quarterly Seasonal Indices**:

| Quarter | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Average | Seasonal Index |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Q1      | 80     | 88     | 92     | 86.7    | 0.85           |
| Q2      | 110    | 115    | 120    | 115.0   | 1.13           |
| Q3      | 95     | 100    | 105    | 100.0   | 0.98           |
| Q4      | 115    | 125    | 130    | 123.3   | 1.21           |

Annual Average = (86.7 + 115.0 + 100.0 + 123.3) / 4 = 106.25

```
Seasonal Index Q1 = 86.7 / 106.25 = 0.82
Seasonal Index Q2 = 115.0 / 106.25 = 1.08
Seasonal Index Q3 = 100.0 / 106.25 = 0.94
Seasonal Index Q4 = 123.3 / 106.25 = 1.16
```

**Application**:
If base forecast for next Q1 is 110 units:
```
Seasonalized Forecast = 110 × 0.82 = 90.2 units
```

### Forecast Accuracy Metrics

#### Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

Most commonly used metric, expressed as percentage.

**Formula**:
```
MAPE = (100 / n) × Σ |Actual - Forecast| / Actual
```

**Example Calculation**:

| Period | Actual | Forecast | Error | |Error| | % Error |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|---------|---------|
| 1      | 100    | 95       | 5     | 5       | 5.0%    |
| 2      | 120    | 115      | 5     | 5       | 4.2%    |
| 3      | 110    | 118      | -8    | 8       | 7.3%    |
| 4      | 130    | 125      | 5     | 5       | 3.8%    |

```
MAPE = (5.0 + 4.2 + 7.3 + 3.8) / 4 = 5.1%
```

**MAPE Interpretation**:
- < 10%: Excellent forecasting
- 10-20%: Good forecasting
- 20-50%: Reasonable forecasting
- > 50%: Poor forecasting

**Limitation**: Cannot use when actual values are zero or near-zero.

#### Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)

Average of absolute errors, measured in same units as demand.

**Formula**:
```
MAD = Σ |Actual - Forecast| / n
```

**Example** (using data above):
```
MAD = (5 + 5 + 8 + 5) / 4 = 5.75 units
```

**Use Case**: Better than MAPE when dealing with low-volume items or zeros.

#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Squares errors to penalize larger deviations more heavily.

**Formula**:
```
MSE = Σ (Actual - Forecast)² / n
```

**Example**:
```
MSE = (25 + 25 + 64 + 25) / 4 = 34.75
```

**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:
```
RMSE = √MSE = √34.75 = 5.90 units
```

**Advantage**: More sensitive to outliers than MAD.

#### Tracking Signal

Monitors forecast bias over time.

**Formula**:
```
Tracking Signal = Running Sum of Forecast Errors (RSFE) / MAD
```

**Acceptable Range**: -4 to +4

**Example**:

| Period | Error | RSFE | MAD | Tracking Signal |
|--------|-------|------|-----|-----------------|
| 1      | 5     | 5    | 5.0 | 1.00            |
| 2      | 5     | 10   | 5.0 | 2.00            |
| 3      | -8    | 2    | 6.0 | 0.33            |
| 4      | 5     | 7    | 5.8 | 1.21            |

**Interpretation**:
- Positive bias: Consistently under-forecasting
- Negative bias: Consistently over-forecasting
- Outside ±4: Investigation required

### Forecast Horizon Guidelines

| Horizon | Methods | Typical Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Short-term (1-3 months) | Moving Average, Simple Exponential Smoothing | Production scheduling, inventory replenishment |
| Medium-term (3-12 months) | Double Exponential Smoothing, Seasonal Models | Capacity planning, workforce scheduling |
| Long-term (1-5 years) | Trend Analysis, Regression, Causal Models | Strategic planning, facility expansion |

### Demand Classification

Classify products to apply appropriate forecasting methods:

**1. Steady Demand**: Consistent pattern with minor fluctuations
- Method: Simple moving average or exponential smoothing
- Example: Staple grocery items

**2. Trending Demand**: Upward or downward trend
- Method: Double exponential smoothing, regression
- Example: Technology adoption, declining products

**3. Seasonal Demand**: Predictable cyclical patterns
- Method: Seasonal indices, Winter's method
- Example: Holiday items, air conditioners

**4. Lumpy/Intermittent Demand**: Sporadic, irregular orders
- Method: Croston's method, probabilistic models
- Example: Spare parts, specialty items

**5. Promotional/Event-driven**: Influenced by marketing activities
- Method: Causal models, judgment-adjusted forecasts
- Example: Sale items, new product launches

### Best Practices for Demand Forecasting

1. **Use Multiple Methods**: Compare 2-3 forecasting approaches
2. **Track Accuracy**: Monitor MAPE monthly and adjust methods
3. **Collaborate**: Incorporate sales, marketing, and operations input
4. **Update Regularly**: Review and recalibrate at least quarterly
5. **Segment Properly**: Don't use same method for all SKUs
6. **Document Assumptions**: Record special events, promotions, changes
7. **Plan for Exceptions**: Have process for handling outliers
8. **Validate Data Quality**: Clean data before forecasting (remove duplicates, correct errors)

### Advanced Considerations

**Forecast Value Add (FVA)**: Measures whether manual adjustments improve accuracy.

```
FVA = Baseline Forecast Accuracy - Final Forecast Accuracy
```

Positive FVA means adjustments helped; negative means they hurt.

**Forecast Bias**:
```
Bias = Σ (Actual - Forecast) / n
```

Zero is ideal. Consistent positive or negative values indicate systematic error.

**Coefficient of Variation (CV)**:
```
CV = Standard Deviation / Mean Demand
```

- CV < 0.25: Low variability, use simple methods
- CV 0.25-0.75: Moderate variability, use exponential smoothing
- CV > 0.75: High variability, consider probabilistic approaches

## Inventory Optimization

Inventory optimization balances the costs of holding stock against the costs of stockouts and ordering.

### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

EOQ determines the optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs.

**Formula**:
```
EOQ = √(2DS / H)
```

Where:
- D = Annual demand (units)
- S = Order cost per order ($)
- H = Annual holding cost per unit ($)

**Total Cost Formula**:
```
Total Cost = (D/Q × S) + (Q/2 × H)
```

Where Q = Order quantity

**Example Calculation**:

Given:
- Annual demand (D) = 10,000 units
- Order cost (S) = $50 per order
- Unit cost = $25
- Holding cost = 20% of unit cost = $5 per unit per year

```
EOQ = √(2 × 10,000 × 50 / 5)
    = √(1,000,000 / 5)
    = √200,000
    = 447 units
```

**Number of Orders per Year**:
```
Number of Orders = D / EOQ = 10,000 / 447 = 22.4 orders
```

**Time Between Orders**:
```
Days Between Orders = 365 / 22.4 = 16.3 days
```

**Total Annual Cost**:
```
Ordering Cost = (10,000 / 447) × $50 = $1,118
Holding Cost = (447 / 2) × $5 = $1,118
Total Cost = $2,236
```

**Key Insight**: At EOQ, ordering costs equal holding costs.

### EOQ Variations

#### EOQ with Quantity Discounts

When suppliers offer price breaks at certain quantities:

**Steps**:
1. Calculate EOQ for each price level
2. If EOQ is feasible for that price range, calculate total cost
3. If EOQ is too low for price break, calculate cost at minimum quantity
4. Choose quantity with lowest total cost

**Example**:

| Quantity Range | Unit Price | Holding Cost (20%) |
|----------------|------------|-------------------|
| 1-499          | $25.00     | $5.00             |
| 500-999        | $24.50     | $4.90             |
| 1000+          | $24.00     | $4.80             |

D = 10,000 units/year, S = $50

**Price Level 1 ($25)**:
```
EOQ₁ = √(2 × 10,000 × 50 / 5) = 447 units (feasible)
Total Cost = (10,000/447 × 50) + (447/2 × 5) + (10,000 × 25)
          = $1,118 + $1,118 + $250,000 = $252,236
```

**Price Level 2 ($24.50)**:
```
EOQ₂ = √(2 × 10,000 × 50 / 4.90) = 452 units (too low)
Use Q = 500 (minimum for discount)
Total Cost = (10,000/500 × 50) + (500/2 × 4.90) + (10,000 × 24.50)
          = $1,000 + $1,225 + $245,000 = $247,225
```

**Price Level 3 ($24)**:
```
Use Q = 1,000 (minimum for discount)
Total Cost = (10,000/1,000 × 50) + (1,000/2 × 4.80) + (10,000 × 24)
          = $500 + $2,400 + $240,000 = $242,900 (BEST)
```

**Decision**: Order 1,000 units despite higher holding costs.

#### Production Order Quantity (POQ)

For items produced internally rather than purchased.

**Formula**:
```
POQ = √(2DS / H × p/(p-d))
```

Where:
- p = Daily production rate
- d = Daily demand rate

**Example**:
- Annual demand = 10,000 units
- Daily demand = 40 units (250 working days)
- Daily production = 80 units
- Setup cost = $100
- Holding cost = $5 per unit per year

```
POQ = √(2 × 10,000 × 100 / 5 × 80/(80-40))
    = √(400,000 × 2)
    = √800,000
    = 894 units
```

### Reorder Point (ROP)

The inventory level at which a new order should be placed.

**Basic Formula**:
```
ROP = (Average Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
```

**Example**:
- Average daily demand = 50 units
- Lead time = 10 days
- Safety stock = 100 units

```
ROP = (50 × 10) + 100 = 600 units
```

**Action**: When inventory drops to 600 units, place order.

### Safety Stock Calculation

Safety stock protects against demand variability and lead time variability.

**Method 1: Fixed Demand, Variable Lead Time**
```
Safety Stock = Z × Demand × σ_LT
```

**Method 2: Variable Demand, Fixed Lead Time**
```
Safety Stock = Z × σ_Demand × √LT
```

**Method 3: Both Variable (Most Common)**
```
Safety Stock = Z × √(LT × σ²_Demand + D² × σ²_LT)
```

Where:
- Z = Service level factor (from Z-table)
- σ_Demand = Standard deviation of demand
- σ_LT = Standard deviation of lead time
- LT = Average lead time
- D = Average demand

**Z-Score for Service Levels**:

| Service Level | Z-Score |
|---------------|---------|
| 90%           | 1.28    |
| 95%           | 1.65    |
| 97%           | 1.88    |
| 99%           | 2.33    |
| 99.9%         | 3.09    |

**Example - Variable Demand Only**:

Given:
- Average daily demand = 100 units
- Standard deviation of demand = 20 units
- Lead time = 7 days (fixed)
- Desired service level = 95%

```
Safety Stock = 1.65 × 20 × √7
            = 1.65 × 20 × 2.65
            = 87.5 ≈ 88 units
```

**ROP Calculation**:
```
ROP = (100 × 7) + 88 = 788 units
```

**Example - Both Variable**:

Given:
- Average daily demand = 100 units
- Standard deviation of demand = 20 units
- Average lead time = 7 days
- Standard deviation of lead time = 2 days
- Service level = 95% (Z = 1.65)

```
Safety Stock = 1.65 × √(7 × 20² + 100² × 2²)
            = 1.65 × √(7 × 400 + 10,000 × 4)
            = 1.65 × √(2,800 + 40,000)
            = 1.65 × √42,800
            = 1.65 × 206.9
            = 341 units
```

### ABC Analysis

ABC analysis categorizes inventory based on value and importance (Pareto 80/20 rule).

**Classification**:
- **A Items**: Top 20% of items = 80% of value (tight control)
- **B Items**: Next 30% of items = 15% of value (moderate control)
- **C Items**: Bottom 50% of items = 5% of value (simple control)

**Steps**:
1. Calculate annual usage value = Annual demand × Unit cost
2. Sort items by annual usage value (descending)
3. Calculate cumulative percentage of total value
4. Classify based on thresholds

**Example**:

| SKU | Annual Demand | Unit Cost | Annual Value | % of Total | Cumulative % | Class |
|-----|---------------|-----------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| 101 | 5,000         | $50       | $250,000     | 41.7%      | 41.7%        | A     |
| 102 | 3,000         | $40       | $120,000     | 20.0%      | 61.7%        | A     |
| 103 | 2,000         | $30       | $60,000      | 10.0%      | 71.7%        | A     |
| 104 | 1,500         | $20       | $30,000      | 5.0%       | 76.7%        | B     |
| 105 | 1,000         | $25       | $25,000      | 4.2%       | 80.9%        | B     |
| 106 | 2,000         | $10       | $20,000      | 3.3%       | 84.2%        | B     |
| 107 | 800           | $15       | $12,000      | 2.0%       | 86.2%        | C     |
| 108 | 1,500         | $5        | $7,500       | 1.3%       | 87.5%        | C     |
| 109 | 1,000         | $5        | $5,000       | 0.8%       | 88.3%        | C     |
| ... | ...           | ...       | ...          | ...        | ...          | C     |

**Management Strategies by Class**:

**A Items** (Critical Focus):
- Daily/weekly review
- Tight inventory control
- Accurate demand forecasting
- Higher service levels (98-99%)
- More frequent ordering (lower safety stock)
- Strong supplier relationships
- Real-time tracking

**B Items** (Moderate Control):
- Weekly/monthly review
- Standard inventory policies
- Periodic demand review
- Service levels 95-97%
- EOQ-based ordering
- Automated reordering

**C Items** (Loose Control):
- Quarterly/annual review
- Simple ordering rules
- Large safety stocks acceptable
- Service levels 90-95%
- Bulk ordering to minimize transactions
- Focus on low administrative cost
- Two-bin systems acceptable

### Inventory Turnover Ratio

Measures how many times inventory is sold and replaced over a period.

**Formula**:
```
Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory Value
```

**Alternative**:
```
Inventory Turnover = Annual Demand / Average Inventory (in units)
```

**Days of Inventory**:
```
Days of Inventory = 365 / Inventory Turnover
```

**Example**:
- Annual COGS = $5,000,000
- Beginning inventory = $800,000
- Ending inventory = $600,000
- Average inventory = ($800,000 + $600,000) / 2 = $700,000

```
Inventory Turnover = $5,000,000 / $700,000 = 7.14 times/year

Days of Inventory = 365 / 7.14 = 51 days
```

**Industry Benchmarks**:

| Industry | Typical Turnover |
|----------|------------------|
| Grocery/Food | 12-15 |
| Pharmaceuticals | 4-6 |
| Electronics | 6-8 |
| Automotive Parts | 4-6 |
| Apparel | 4-5 |
| Furniture | 3-4 |

**Interpretation**:
- Higher turnover = Less capital tied up, lower holding costs
- Too high = Risk of stockouts, lost sales
- Lower turnover = Higher holding costs, obsolescence risk
- Too low = Overstocking, poor cash flow

### Inventory Accuracy

**Formula**:
```
Inventory Accuracy = (Number of Accurate Items / Total Items Counted) × 100%
```

**Target**: 95%+ accuracy for all items, 99%+ for A items.

**Cycle Counting Frequency**:
- A items: Monthly or weekly
- B items: Quarterly
- C items: Semi-annually or annually

### Service Level vs. Inventory Cost

Trade-off between service level and inventory investment:

**Example Comparison**:

| Service Level | Safety Stock | Average Inventory | Annual Holding Cost |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 90%           | 50 units     | 275 units         | $1,375              |
| 95%           | 88 units     | 313 units         | $1,565              |
| 99%           | 133 units    | 358 units         | $1,790              |

Note: Each additional 5% service level requires disproportionately more inventory.

**Optimal Service Level Decision**:
```
Optimal when: Cost of Safety Stock = Cost of Stockout × Probability of Stockout
```

### Multi-Echelon Inventory Optimization

For supply chains with multiple stocking locations (warehouses, distribution centers, retail).

**Key Principle**: Don't optimize each location independently; optimize total system inventory.

**Approaches**:
1. **Base Stock Policies**: Each location maintains inventory to target level
2. **Risk Pooling**: Centralize safety stock at higher echelon
3. **Virtual Pooling**: Share inventory information and redistribute

**Safety Stock Reduction from Centralization**:
```
Centralized Safety Stock = √n × Decentralized Safety Stock per Location
```

Where n = number of locations

**Example**:
- 4 retail locations, each with 100 units safety stock
- Decentralized total = 400 units

```
Centralized = √4 × 100 = 2 × 100 = 200 units
Savings = 400 - 200 = 200 units (50% reduction)
```

### Inventory Carrying Cost Components

**Typical Breakdown** (as % of inventory value):

| Component | Typical % | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Cost of Capital | 8-15% | Opportunity cost of funds |
| Storage Space | 2-5% | Warehouse rent, utilities |
| Inventory Services | 2-4% | Insurance, taxes |
| Inventory Risk | 5-10% | Obsolescence, shrinkage, damage |
| **Total** | **20-30%** | Industry average |

**Calculation Example**:
- Item value = $50
- Annual holding cost rate = 25%
- Annual holding cost per unit = $50 × 0.25 = $12.50

### Slow-Moving and Obsolete Inventory

**Metrics**:

**1. Months on Hand (MOH)**:
```
MOH = Current Inventory / Average Monthly Usage
```

**2. Aging Analysis**:

| Age | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 0-6 months | Normal stock |
| 6-12 months | Review and reduce |
| 12-24 months | Discount/promote |
| 24+ months | Liquidate or write off |

**3. Dead Stock**:
No movement in past 12 months.

**Management Actions**:
1. Price reductions (10-50% discounts)
2. Bundling with fast movers
3. Return to supplier (if possible)
4. Liquidation through secondary channels
5. Write-off (tax deduction)

**Prevention**:
- Improve demand forecasting
- Implement ABC analysis
- Tighter purchasing controls on C items
- Regular review cycles
- Phase-out planning for declining products

## Logistics and Distribution

Logistics encompasses the movement and storage of goods from suppliers to customers.

### Transportation Mode Selection

Choose transportation mode based on cost, speed, reliability, and cargo characteristics.

**Mode Comparison**:

| Mode | Speed | Cost | Capacity | Flexibility | Typical Use |
|------|-------|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Air | Fastest | Highest | Low | High | Urgent, high-value items |
| Truck | Fast | High | Medium | Highest | Short-medium distance, flexible |
| Rail | Moderate | Moderate | High | Moderate | Bulk goods, long distance |
| Ship | Slowest | Lowest | Highest | Low | International, bulk, non-urgent |
| Pipeline | Steady | Low | High | Lowest | Liquids, gases (oil, natural gas) |

**Decision Matrix Example**:

Product: Electronics components
Volume: 2,000 kg
Distance: 1,500 km
Urgency: 3 days required

| Factor | Weight | Air | Truck | Rail |
|--------|--------|-----|-------|------|
| Cost | 30% | 2 | 7 | 8 |
| Speed | 40% | 10 | 7 | 4 |
| Reliability | 20% | 9 | 8 | 6 |
| Flexibility | 10% | 7 | 10 | 5 |
| **Weighted Score** | | **7.1** | **7.5** | **5.9** |

**Decision**: Truck transport (highest score).

### Transportation Cost Calculation

**Formula**:
```
Cost per Unit = (Fixed Cost + Variable Cost × Distance × Weight) / Number of Units
```

**Example**:
- Fixed cost (loading/unloading) = $200
- Variable cost = $0.50 per km per ton
- Distance = 500 km
- Weight = 10 tons
- Units shipped = 1,000

```
Total Cost = $200 + ($0.50 × 500 × 10)
          = $200 + $2,500
          = $2,700

Cost per Unit = $2,700 / 1,000 = $2.70
```

### Load Consolidation

Combine multiple shipments to achieve better rates and efficiency.

**Benefits**:
- Lower cost per unit (economies of scale)
- Reduced handling
- Better carrier rates
- Environmental benefits

**Full Truckload (FTL) vs. Less Than Truckload (LTL)**:

| Factor | FTL | LTL |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Volume | 10,000+ lbs or 12+ pallets | < 10,000 lbs |
| Cost | Lower per lb (if you fill truck) | Higher per lb |
| Transit Time | Faster (direct) | Slower (multiple stops) |
| Handling | Less | More (higher damage risk) |
| Flexibility | Less (need full load) | More (ship smaller quantities) |

**Break-even Analysis**:

When does consolidation make sense?

**Example**:
- LTL rate = $15 per 100 lbs
- FTL rate = $1,200 flat rate
- FTL capacity = 40,000 lbs

```
LTL Cost for 40,000 lbs = 40,000/100 × $15 = $6,000
FTL Cost = $1,200
Savings = $4,800

Break-even Point = $1,200 / $15 per 100 lbs = 8,000 lbs
```

**Decision**: Use FTL if shipping > 8,000 lbs.

### Route Optimization

Minimize total distance or time for multiple delivery stops.

**Basic Principles**:
1. **Nearest Neighbor**: From current location, go to nearest unvisited stop
2. **Savings Algorithm**: Pair stops that save most distance when combined
3. **Clustering**: Group nearby stops into routes

**Simple Example - Nearest Neighbor**:

Depot and 4 delivery locations:
- Depot: (0, 0)
- A: (2, 3)
- B: (5, 5)
- C: (7, 2)
- D: (4, 8)

**Step 1**: From Depot, find nearest (A at distance 3.6)
**Step 2**: From A, find nearest unvisited (B at distance 3.6)
**Step 3**: From B, find nearest unvisited (C at distance 3.6)
**Step 4**: From C, visit D (distance 6.7)
**Step 5**: Return to Depot from D (distance 8.9)

Route: Depot → A → B → C → D → Depot
Total Distance: 26.4 units

**Advanced**: Use routing software for complex scenarios (10+ stops).

**Factors to Consider**:
- Time windows (delivery between 9am-11am)
- Vehicle capacity constraints
- Driver hours regulations
- Traffic patterns
- Priority deliveries

### Warehouse Operations

Efficient warehouse operations reduce costs and improve order fulfillment.

#### Warehouse Layout Principles

**1. Flow Optimization**:
```
Receiving → Putaway → Storage → Picking → Packing → Shipping
```

Minimize backtracking and cross-traffic.

**2. ABC Slotting**:
- Place A items (fast movers) closest to packing/shipping
- Place C items (slow movers) in remote areas
- Medium movers in between

**3. Vertical Storage**:
- Heavy items on lower shelves (safety, efficiency)
- Light items on upper shelves
- Medium-sized items at waist height (ergonomics)

**4. Cross-Docking**:
Directly transfer inbound goods to outbound trucks without storage.
- Reduces handling and storage costs
- Requires tight coordination
- Best for fast-moving, pre-allocated goods

#### Receiving Process

**Steps**:
1. Unload from carrier
2. Verify shipment against purchase order
3. Inspect for damage
4. Document discrepancies
5. Label and stage for putaway

**Key Metrics**:
- **Receiving Time**: < 30 minutes per truck
- **Accuracy**: 99%+ match to PO
- **Damage Rate**: < 1% of received items

#### Putaway Process

Moving goods from receiving to storage locations.

**Methods**:
1. **Directed Putaway**: WMS assigns specific location
2. **Random Putaway**: Any available location (requires good tracking)
3. **Fixed Location**: Each SKU has designated spots

**Best Practice**: Directed putaway with ABC slotting.

**Efficiency Metric**:
```
Putaway Rate = Units Put Away / Labor Hours
```

Target: 100-200 units per hour (varies by item type).

#### Picking Process

Most labor-intensive warehouse activity (50-60% of operating costs).

**Picking Methods**:

**1. Piece Picking (Pick-to-Order)**:
- One order at a time
- Simple but slowest
- Best for: Low volume, high customization

**2. Batch Picking**:
- Pick multiple orders simultaneously
- Group similar picks
- Best for: Medium volume, similar products

**3. Zone Picking**:
- Divide warehouse into zones
- Each picker covers one zone
- Order passes through zones
- Best for: Large warehouses, diverse products

**4. Wave Picking**:
- Pick multiple orders at scheduled times ("waves")
- Consolidate after picking
- Best for: High volume, scheduled shipments

**Picking Accuracy**:
```
Pick Accuracy = (Correct Picks / Total Picks) × 100%
```

Target: 99.5%+

**Picking Productivity**:
```
Lines Picked per Hour = Total Lines Picked / Total Picker Hours
```

Industry Average: 40-60 lines per hour (varies widely by product type).

**Golden Zone**: Position items 48-60 inches from floor (optimal ergonomics, fastest picking).

#### Packing and Shipping

**Packing Standards**:
1. Right-sized packaging (minimize void fill)
2. Protection adequate for transportation mode
3. Clear labeling (destination, handling instructions)
4. Documentation (packing slip, shipping label)

**Shipping Metrics**:
- **On-Time Shipment Rate**: 98%+
- **Shipping Cost as % of Revenue**: 5-10% (industry varies)
- **Orders Shipped per Day**: Depends on scale

**Dock Scheduling**:
Assign time slots to carriers to avoid congestion.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce wait times
- Smooth labor demand
- Better space utilization

### 3PL (Third-Party Logistics) Management

Outsourcing logistics to specialized providers.

**When to Use 3PL**:
- Seasonal demand fluctuations
- Lack of logistics expertise
- Geographic expansion

**Example 3PL Cost Calculation**:

Monthly volume:
- 100 pallets stored (average)
- 500 inbound receipts
- 1,000 orders, 2 items each
- 1,000 packages shipped

```
Storage: 100 pallets × $10 = $1,000
Inbound: 500 receipts × $0.50 = $250
Picking: 2,000 items × $0.40 = $800
Packing: 1,000 orders × $2 = $2,000
Outbound: 1,000 packages × $6 = $6,000
Total = $10,050/month
```

**3PL Selection Criteria**:
1. Geographic coverage
2. Technology capabilities (WMS, visibility)
3. Industry expertise
4. Scalability
5. References and track record
6. Financial stability
7. Value-added services

### Inbound vs. Outbound Logistics

**Process**:
1. Customer initiates return
2. Authorization (RMA - Return Merchandise Authorization)
3. Return shipping
4. Receiving and inspection
5. Disposition (restock, refurbish, scrap)
6. Refund/replacement

**Metrics**:
- **Return Rate**: < 2% for most products (higher for apparel, electronics)
- **Processing Time**: 3-5 days from receipt to disposition
- **Recovery Rate**: Value recovered / Original value

**Cost Considerations**:
- Return shipping: $5-$15 per package
- Inspection labor: $2-$5 per item
- Restocking: 10-30% of item value lost

**Strategies to Reduce Returns**:
1. Accurate product descriptions
2. Quality control
3. Better packaging
4. Customer education
5. Sizing guides (apparel)

- 70-79: Acceptable (Conditional)
- Below 70: Poor (Improvement plan required)

**Review Frequency**:
- Strategic suppliers: Monthly
- Preferred suppliers: Quarterly
- Transactional suppliers: Annually

### Key Vendor Performance Metrics

#### 1. On-Time Delivery (OTD)

**Formula**:
```
OTD % = (Deliveries on Time / Total Deliveries) × 100%
```

**On-Time Definition**: Within agreed delivery window (e.g., +/- 1 day).

**Example**:
- 95 deliveries on time out of 100
- OTD = 95%

**Industry Benchmarks**:
- Manufacturing: 95-98%
- Retail: 98-99%
- Critical components: 99%+

#### 2. Quality Metrics

**Defect Rate**:
```
Defect Rate = (Defective Units / Total Units Received) × 100%
```

**Parts Per Million (PPM)**:
```
PPM = (Defective Units / Total Units) × 1,000,000
```

**Example**:
- 15 defective units out of 10,000
- Defect rate = 0.15%
- PPM = 1,500

**Quality Targets**:
- Standard: < 1% defect rate (< 10,000 PPM)
- High-quality: < 0.1% (< 1,000 PPM)
- Six Sigma: < 3.4 PPM

**First Pass Yield (FPY)**:
```
FPY = (Units Accepted on First Inspection / Total Units Inspected) × 100%
```

Target: 98%+

#### 3. Lead Time Performance

**Formula**:
```
Average Lead Time = Σ (Delivery Date - Order Date) / Number of Orders
```

**Lead Time Variability**:
```
Standard Deviation of Lead Time = σ_LT
```

Lower variability = more predictable = less safety stock needed.

**Example**:

| Order | Order Date | Delivery Date | Lead Time (days) |
|-------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| 1 | Jan 1 | Jan 15 | 14 |
| 2 | Jan 5 | Jan 22 | 17 |
| 3 | Jan 10 | Jan 26 | 16 |
| 4 | Jan 15 | Jan 28 | 13 |
| 5 | Jan 20 | Feb 5 | 16 |

```
Average Lead Time = (14 + 17 + 16 + 13 + 16) / 5 = 15.2 days
Standard Deviation = 1.48 days (low variability is good)
```

#### 4. Price Performance

**Price Variance**:
```
Price Variance = ((Actual Price - Standard Price) / Standard Price) × 100%
```

**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**:
```
TCO = Purchase Price + Freight + Quality Costs + Inventory Carrying + Admin Costs
```

**Example**:
- Supplier A: $100 purchase price + $5 freight + $2 quality issues = $107 TCO
- Supplier B: $95 purchase price + $10 freight + $5 quality issues = $110 TCO

**Decision**: Supplier A has lower TCO despite higher unit price.

#### 5. Responsiveness

**Response Time**:
Time from inquiry/issue to supplier response.

**Resolution Time**:
Time from issue raised to issue fully resolved.

**Targets**:
- Email response: < 24 hours
- Quote turnaround: 2-5 business days
- Issue resolution: 3-7 days (depending on severity)

- 5% of suppliers = Strategic (50% of spend)

Focus relationship management efforts on strategic tier.

---

## Key Performance Metrics

Measure and monitor supply chain performance across multiple dimensions.

### Perfect Order Rate

The ultimate supply chain metric: percentage of orders delivered complete, on-time, damage-free, and with accurate documentation.

**Formula**:
```
Perfect Order Rate = (Orders Meeting All Criteria / Total Orders) × 100%
```

**Criteria**:
1. **Complete**: All items in correct quantities
2. **On-Time**: Delivered within promised window
3. **Damage-Free**: No damage or defects
4. **Accurate Documentation**: Correct invoice, packing slip, labels

**Calculation Method**:
```
Perfect Order Rate = (% Complete) × (% On-Time) × (% Damage-Free) × (% Accurate)
```

**Example**:
- 98% complete
- 95% on-time
- 99% damage-free
- 97% accurate documentation

```
Perfect Order Rate = 0.98 × 0.95 × 0.99 × 0.97 = 0.893 = 89.3%
```

**Industry Benchmarks**:
- World-class: 95-98%
- Average: 85-90%
- Poor: < 80%

**Impact**: 1% improvement in perfect order rate can reduce costs by 5-10% due to reduced rework, returns, and expediting.

### Cash-to-Cash Cycle Time

Measures how quickly cash invested in inventory converts back to cash.

**Formula**:
```
Cash-to-Cash Cycle = Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) + Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) - Days Payables Outstanding (DPO)
```

**Component Formulas**:

**Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)**:
```
DIO = (Average Inventory / COGS) × 365
```

**Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**:
```
DSO = (Accounts Receivable / Revenue) × 365
```

**Days Payables Outstanding (DPO)**:
```
DPO = (Accounts Payable / COGS) × 365
```

**Example Calculation**:

Given:
- Average inventory = $500,000
- COGS = $3,650,000
- Accounts receivable = $400,000
- Revenue = $4,380,000
- Accounts payable = $300,000

```
DIO = ($500,000 / $3,650,000) × 365 = 50 days
DSO = ($400,000 / $4,380,000) × 365 = 33 days
DPO = ($300,000 / $3,650,000) × 365 = 30 days

Cash-to-Cash Cycle = 50 + 33 - 30 = 53 days
```

**Interpretation**:
- 53 days: Capital is tied up for 53 days before converting back to cash
- Lower is better (more efficient use of capital)
- Negative = Receiving cash before paying suppliers (ideal)

**Industry Benchmarks**:

| Industry | Typical C2C Cycle |
|----------|-------------------|
| Retail | 30-60 days |
| Manufacturing | 60-90 days |
| Technology | 40-70 days |
| Consumer Goods | 50-80 days |

**Improvement Strategies**:
- Reduce DIO: Improve inventory turnover (better forecasting, reduce safety stock)
- Reduce DSO: Faster customer collections (payment terms, credit policies)
- Increase DPO: Negotiate longer payment terms with suppliers (without damaging relationships)

### Fill Rate

Percentage of customer demand satisfied from available inventory.

**Formula**:
```
Fill Rate = (Quantity Delivered / Quantity Ordered) × 100%
```

**Variations**:

**Line Fill Rate**:
```
Line Fill Rate = (Order Lines Completely Filled / Total Order Lines) × 100%
```

**Order Fill Rate**:
```
Order Fill Rate = (Orders Completely Filled / Total Orders) × 100%
```

**Example**:

Order with 5 line items:
- Line 1: 100 units ordered, 100 delivered (100%)
- Line 2: 50 units ordered, 50 delivered (100%)
- Line 3: 75 units ordered, 60 delivered (80%)
- Line 4: 200 units ordered, 200 delivered (100%)
- Line 5: 30 units ordered, 30 delivered (100%)

```
Unit Fill Rate = (100 + 50 + 60 + 200 + 30) / (100 + 50 + 75 + 200 + 30)
               = 440 / 455 = 96.7%

Line Fill Rate = 4 complete lines / 5 total lines = 80%

Order Fill Rate = 0% (order not complete)
```

**Target Fill Rates**:

| Product Category | Target |
|------------------|--------|
| Critical/A Items | 98-99% |
| Standard/B Items | 95-97% |
| Low Priority/C Items | 90-95% |

**Cost Impact**:
Each 1% improvement in fill rate can reduce expediting costs by 10-15%.

### Inventory Days of Supply

How many days current inventory will last at current sales rate.

**Formula**:
```
Days of Supply = (Current Inventory / Average Daily Usage)
```

**Alternative**:
```
Days of Supply = (Average Inventory / COGS) × 365
```

**Example**:
- Current inventory = 5,000 units
- Average daily usage = 100 units

```
Days of Supply = 5,000 / 100 = 50 days
```

**Interpretation**:
- 50 days: Current inventory will last 50 days at current usage rate
- Monitor trends: Increasing days = overstocking; Decreasing = potential shortage

**Target Days of Supply**:

| Product Type | Target |
|--------------|--------|
| Fast-moving/Perishable | 15-30 days |
| Standard Products | 30-60 days |
| Slow-moving | 60-90 days |
| Seasonal | Pre-season: 90+ days, In-season: 30 days |

**By Industry**:
- Grocery: 7-14 days
- Electronics: 30-45 days
- Automotive: 45-60 days
- Pharmaceuticals: 60-90 days

### Order Cycle Time

Total time from order placement to delivery.

**Formula**:
```
Order Cycle Time = Order Received Date - Order Placement Date
```

**Components**:
1. Order processing: 0.5-1 day
2. Picking and packing: 0.5-1 day
3. Shipping: 1-5 days (depending on method)
4. Total: 2-7 days (typical)

**Benchmark Targets**:

| Customer Type | Target |
|---------------|--------|
| B2C E-commerce | 2-5 days |
| B2B Standard | 3-7 days |
| B2B Expedited | 1-2 days |

**Metric Variation - Order Lead Time Variability**:
```
Lead Time Standard Deviation = σ_LT
```

Lower variability = more predictable = better planning = less safety stock needed.

**Example**:
- Average cycle time = 5 days
- Standard deviation = 1 day (good consistency)
- Standard deviation = 3 days (high variability, need more safety stock)

### Supply Chain Cost Metrics

**Total Logistics Cost as % of Sales**:
```
Logistics Cost % = (Total Logistics Costs / Total Sales Revenue) × 100%
```

**Components**:
- Transportation: 40-50% of logistics costs
- Warehousing: 20-30%
- Inventory carrying: 15-25%
- Administration: 5-10%

**Industry Benchmarks**:

| Industry | Logistics Cost % of Sales |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Retail | 7-10% |
| Manufacturing | 8-12% |
| Wholesale Distribution | 10-15% |
| E-commerce | 12-18% |

**Cost to Serve (CTS)**:
```
CTS = Total Supply Chain Costs / Total Units Delivered
```

Measures total cost to deliver one unit to customer.

**Example**:
- Annual supply chain costs = $5,000,000
- Units delivered = 500,000
- CTS = $10 per unit

**Use**: Compare CTS across customer segments, channels, or product lines.

### Supplier Performance Metrics

**Supplier On-Time Delivery**:
```
Supplier OTD = (On-Time Deliveries / Total Deliveries) × 100%
```

Target: 95-98%

**Supplier Quality**:
```
Supplier Defect Rate = (Defective Units / Total Units Received) × 100%
```

Target: < 1%

**Supplier Lead Time**:
```
Average Supplier Lead Time = Σ (Delivery Date - Order Date) / Number of Orders
```

Monitor trends: Increasing lead time = potential supply risk.

### Forecast Accuracy

**Formula**:
```
Forecast Accuracy = 100% - MAPE
```

Where MAPE = Mean Absolute Percentage Error (calculated earlier in demand forecasting section).

**Alternative - Bias**:
```
Forecast Bias = Σ (Actual - Forecast) / Σ Actual × 100%
```

- Positive bias = Under-forecasting
- Negative bias = Over-forecasting
- Zero bias = Unbiased (ideal)

**Benchmark Targets**:

| Product Category | Target Accuracy |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Stable/Mature | 90-95% |
| Growth Products | 80-90% |
| New Products | 60-80% |
| Promotional | 70-85% |

### Warehouse Productivity Metrics

**Units Picked per Labor Hour**:
```
Pick Rate = Total Units Picked / Total Labor Hours
```

Benchmark: 100-200 units/hour (varies by product type).

**Orders Shipped per Labor Hour**:
```
Ship Rate = Total Orders Shipped / Total Labor Hours
```

Benchmark: 15-30 orders/hour.

**Dock-to-Stock Time**:
```
Dock-to-Stock Time = Time Item Available in System - Time Item Received
```

Target: < 24 hours for standard items.

**Warehouse Capacity Utilization**:
```
Capacity Utilization = (Used Space / Total Available Space) × 100%
```

Optimal: 85-90% (allows flexibility for fluctuations).

### Transportation Metrics

**On-Time Delivery (Carrier)**:
```
Carrier OTD = (On-Time Shipments / Total Shipments) × 100%
```

Target: 95-98%

**Freight Cost per Unit**:
```
Freight Cost per Unit = Total Freight Costs / Total Units Shipped
```

**Transportation Cost as % of Sales**:
```
Transportation % = (Total Transportation Costs / Revenue) × 100%
```

Benchmark: 4-8% (varies by industry and geography).

**Average Miles per Delivery**:
```
Miles per Delivery = Total Miles / Number of Deliveries
```

Track to identify routing inefficiencies.

**Load Factor** (Truck Utilization):
```
Load Factor = (Actual Weight or Volume / Max Capacity) × 100%
```

Target: 85-95% (maximize efficiency without overloading).

### Dashboard Framework

Organize metrics into a balanced scorecard:

**Strategic Level** (Executive Dashboard):
- Perfect Order Rate
- Cash-to-Cash Cycle
- Total Supply Chain Cost as % of Sales
- Inventory Days of Supply
- Customer Satisfaction Score

**Tactical Level** (Operations Dashboard):
- Fill Rate
- Order Cycle Time
- Warehouse Productivity
- Supplier OTD
- Forecast Accuracy

**Operational Level** (Daily Dashboard):
- Units Picked per Hour
- Orders Shipped Today
- Backorder Count
- Dock Congestion
- Inventory Accuracy

**Recommended Review Frequency**:
- Strategic: Monthly or Quarterly
- Tactical: Weekly
- Operational: Daily or Real-time

### Continuous Improvement

**Benchmarking Process**:
1. Identify metrics to benchmark
2. Find comparable companies/industry data
3. Calculate performance gap
4. Set improvement targets
5. Implement initiatives
6. Monitor progress

**Example**:
- Current Perfect Order Rate: 87%
- Industry benchmark: 92%
- Gap: 5%
- Target: Improve to 90% within 6 months, 92% within 12 months

**Root Cause Analysis**:
When metrics miss target, use structured problem-solving:
1. Define the problem
2. Collect data
3. Identify root causes (5 Whys, Fishbone diagram)
4. Develop solutions
5. Implement and verify
6. Standardize

**Leading vs. Lagging Indicators**:

**Lagging** (Results): Perfect Order Rate, Cash-to-Cash Cycle
**Leading** (Predictive): Forecast accuracy, Supplier quality trends, Backorder rate

Monitor leading indicators to predict and prevent problems with lagging indicators.
