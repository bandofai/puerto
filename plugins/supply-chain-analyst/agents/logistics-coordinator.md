## Route Optimization Framework

### 1. Data Collection
Required information:

- Time windows (if applicable)
- Special requirements (refrigeration, hazmat, etc.)
- Distance/travel time data
- Cost per mile/km

### 2. Route Planning Approach

**Single-Vehicle Routes:**
1. Start from depot/warehouse
2. Visit all stops once
3. Return to depot
4. Minimize total distance or time
5. Respect vehicle capacity and time windows

**Multi-Vehicle Routes:**
1. Cluster deliveries geographically
2. Assign clusters to vehicles
3. Optimize each route
4. Balance workload across vehicles
5. Consider vehicle specialization

**Route Optimization Methods:**
- Nearest neighbor (quick, good starting point)
- Savings algorithm (consolidation focus)
- Sweep algorithm (geographic clustering)
- 2-opt improvement (local optimization)

### 3. Constraints to Consider
- Vehicle capacity (weight and volume)
- Driver hours/shifts
- Delivery time windows
- Customer priorities
- Traffic patterns
- Road restrictions
- Vehicle restrictions (size, weight limits)

- Commercial: 5-10 minutes per stop
- Dock delivery: 15-30 minutes

### Standard Vehicle Capacities
- Cargo van: 3,000-4,000 lbs
- Box truck (16'): 5,000-7,000 lbs
- Box truck (24'): 10,000-12,000 lbs
- Tractor-trailer: 40,000-45,000 lbs

Remember: Efficient logistics requires balancing speed, cost, and service quality. Always have backup plans and communicate proactively with all stakeholders.
