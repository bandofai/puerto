## Inventory Optimization Framework

### 1. Data Collection & Validation
- Current inventory levels
- Historical demand data
- Lead times (average and variability)
- Costs (holding, ordering, stockout)
- Service level targets
- Product attributes

### 2. Classification
**ABC Analysis** (by value):
- A items: 70-80% of value, 10-20% of items (tight control)
- B items: 15-25% of value, 20-30% of items (moderate control)
- C items: 5-10% of value, 50-70% of items (simple control)

**XYZ Analysis** (by variability):
- X items: Low variability (CV < 0.5) - predictable
- Y items: Medium variability (0.5 ≤ CV < 1.0) - moderate
- Z items: High variability (CV ≥ 1.0) - unpredictable

### 3. Optimization Calculations

#### Safety Stock Formula
```
Safety Stock = Z × σ_LT × √(Lead Time)

Where:
- Z = Service level factor (e.g., 1.65 for 95%, 1.96 for 97.5%)
- σ_LT = Standard deviation of demand during lead time
- Lead Time = Average lead time in same units as demand
```

#### Reorder Point
```
ROP = (Average Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
```

#### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
```
EOQ = √(2 × D × S / H)

Where:
- D = Annual demand
- S = Ordering cost per order
- H = Holding cost per unit per year
```

#### Min-Max Levels
```
Minimum = ROP
Maximum = ROP + EOQ
```

### 4. Service Level Targets

| Service Level | Z-Score | Stockout Risk |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 90%          | 1.28    | 10%           |
| 95%          | 1.65    | 5%            |
| 97.5%        | 1.96    | 2.5%          |
| 99%          | 2.33    | 1%            |
| 99.9%        | 3.09    | 0.1%          |

## Common Scenarios

### High-Value, Low-Volume (A Items)
- Calculate precise safety stock
- Monitor daily
- Use vendor-managed inventory if possible
- Maintain close supplier relationships
- Consider just-in-time approaches

### Low-Value, High-Volume (C Items)
- Use simple min-max rules
- Order in bulk for economies
- Review periodically (monthly/quarterly)
- Accept some stockouts if cost-effective
- Consider two-bin systems

### Erratic Demand (Z Items)
- Set higher safety stocks
- Use probability-based approaches
- Monitor more frequently
- Consider make-to-order
- Build supplier flexibility

### Seasonal Products
- Adjust safety stock by season
- Plan build-up in advance
- Calculate seasonal EOQ
- Monitor aging carefully
- Plan clearance strategies

### New Products
- Start with conservative parameters
- Adjust quickly with actual data
- Use analogous product data
- Monitor closely in first 3 months
- Build supplier flexibility

## Key Formulas Reference

### Inventory Turnover
```
Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory Value
```

### Days on Hand
```
Days on Hand = 365 / Turnover Ratio
```

### Fill Rate
```
Fill Rate = (Demand Met / Total Demand) × 100%
```

### Coefficient of Variation
```
CV = Standard Deviation / Mean
```

### Carrying Cost Rate
```
Typical range: 15-30% per year
Includes: storage, insurance, obsolescence, capital cost
```

## Decision Rules

### When to Reorder
- Current inventory ≤ Reorder Point
- Projected inventory ≤ ROP (with scheduled receipts)

### Order Quantity Decisions
- Use EOQ for regular, predictable items
- Adjust for supplier minimum order quantities
- Consider quantity discounts
- Account for shelf life constraints
- Factor in storage capacity

### Safety Stock Adjustments
- Increase for: higher service level, longer lead time, higher variability
- Decrease for: lower service level, shorter lead time, lower variability
- Review when demand patterns change
- Adjust for promotional periods

## Deliverables

Every optimization analysis should include:
1. Current state assessment
2. ABC/XYZ classification
3. Optimized parameters (ROP, safety stock, EOQ)
4. Cost-benefit analysis
5. Implementation recommendations
6. Monitoring plan
7. Visual dashboards
8. Action items with priorities

## Red Flags to Watch

- Inventory turnover < 4× per year (potential overstocking)
- Fill rate < 95% (potential understocking)
- Dead stock > 10% of inventory value
- Safety stock consistently not used (too high)
- Frequent stockouts (safety stock too low)
- CV > 1.0 with standard methods (need specialized approach)

Remember: The goal is to minimize total inventory costs while maintaining target service levels. Every recommendation should be backed by data and clearly show the cost-benefit tradeoff.
