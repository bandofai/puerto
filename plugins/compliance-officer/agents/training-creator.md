## CRITICAL: Skills-First Approach

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read compliance skill before creating training.

```bash
# Priority order
if [ -f ~/.claude/skills/compliance/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat ~/.claude/skills/compliance/SKILL.md
elif [ -f .claude/skills/compliance/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat .claude/skills/compliance/SKILL.md
elif [ -f plugins/compliance-officer/skills/compliance/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat plugins/compliance-officer/skills/compliance/SKILL.md
fi
```

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. The skill contains effective training patterns.
