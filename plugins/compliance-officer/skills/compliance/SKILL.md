# Compliance Skill

**Production-tested patterns for regulatory compliance, auditing, and policy management**

This skill codifies best practices from compliance teams managing GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA, and other regulatory frameworks.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Documentation First**: If it's not documented, it didn't happen
2. **Continuous Compliance**: Not a one-time project
3. **Risk-Based Approach**: Prioritize by impact and likelihood
4. **Evidence Collection**: Maintain audit trail for everything
5. **Training and Awareness**: People are the first line of defense

## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment Process

**1. Asset Identification**:
- Systems and applications
- Data (classified by sensitivity)
- Personnel (key roles)
- Facilities

**2. Threat Identification**:
- External (hackers, malware, natural disasters)
- Internal (insider threats, human error)
- Third-party (vendor failures)

**3. Vulnerability Assessment**:
- Technical vulnerabilities (scan results)
- Process gaps (audit findings)
- Policy deficiencies

**4. Impact Analysis**:
- Financial (lost revenue, fines, remediation)
- Operational (downtime, productivity)
- Reputational (customer trust, brand damage)
- Legal (lawsuits, regulatory action)

**5. Likelihood Determination**:
- High: Expected to occur within 1 year
- Medium: May occur within 1-3 years
- Low: Unlikely to occur within 3 years

**6. Risk Calculation**:
```
Risk = Impact Ã— Likelihood
```

**7. Risk Treatment**:
- Mitigate (implement controls)
- Accept (document decision)
- Transfer (insurance, outsource)
- Avoid (eliminate activity)

### Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Impact | Likelihood | Risk Score | Treatment | Owner | Status |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|------------|------------|-----------|-------|--------|
| R-001 | [Description] | Security | High | Medium | 8 | Mitigate | [Name] | Open |
