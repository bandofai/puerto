- Contact lists (media, stakeholders)
- Monitoring systems
- Training and simulations
- Resource allocation
- Backup systems

**3. Response (Action)**
- Crisis activation and assessment
- Immediate communication (golden hour)
- Stakeholder notifications
- Media management
- Social media response
- Ongoing updates
- Coordination and escalation
- Message consistency

**4. Recovery (Resolution)**

- Brand restoration

### SCCT (Situational Crisis Communication Theory)

**Crisis Types by Attribution**:

**Victim Cluster** (Low Attribution):
- Natural disasters
- Workplace violence
- Product tampering
- Rumors
- Response: Instructing information, care response

**Accidental Cluster** (Minimal Attribution):
- Technical error accidents
- Product recalls (unintentional)
- Megadamage
- Response: Instructing information, adjusting information

**Preventable Cluster** (Strong Attribution):
- Human error accidents
- Organizational misconduct
- Management failures
- Response: Rebuilding strategies (apology, compensation)

**Response Strategies**:

**Denial Posture**:
- Attack accuser: Confront accusers
- Denial: Assert crisis didn't occur
- Scapegoat: Blame external entity
- Use when: False accusations, victim crisis

**Diminishment Posture**:
- Excuse: Minimize responsibility
- Justification: Minimize damage perception
- Use when: Accidental crises, low severity

**Rebuilding Posture**:
- Compensation: Offer money, gifts
- Apology: Full responsibility, ask forgiveness
- Use when: Preventable crises, high severity

**Bolstering Posture** (Supplemental):
- Reminder: Past good works
- Ingratiation: Praise stakeholders
- Victimage: Organization is victim too
- Use with: Any response strategy

### Image Restoration Theory

**Response Strategies**:

**1. Denial**:
- Simple denial: "It didn't happen"
- Shifting blame: "Someone else is responsible"

**2. Evasion of Responsibility**:
- Provocation: "We were responding to another's action"
- Defeasibility: "Lack of information/control"
- Accident: "Unintentional event"
- Good intentions: "We meant well"

**3. Reducing Offensiveness**:
- Bolstering: Remind of positive attributes
- Minimization: "It's not that serious"
- Differentiation: "Could have been worse"
- Transcendence: "Higher purpose"
- Attack accuser: Reduce credibility
- Compensation: Reimburse victims

**4. Corrective Action**:
- Restore situation
- Prevent recurrence
- Show concrete steps

**5. Mortification**:
- Full apology
- Accept responsibility
- Ask forgiveness

## Internal vs External Communication

### Internal Communication Principles

**Employees First**:
- Never let employees learn from media
- Brief before external announcement
- Provide full context (more detail than public)
- Equip with talking points for customer interactions
- Regular updates (daily if crisis ongoing)

**Communication Channels**:
- **Urgent**: All-hands meeting, emergency alert
- **Important**: CEO email, intranet announcement
- **Ongoing**: Daily email updates, manager cascade
- **Q&A**: Town halls, Slack/Teams channel, FAQ document

**Employee Message Template**:
```markdown
Subject: Important Update: [Crisis Situation]

Team,

I wanted to reach out directly before you hear about this situation
elsewhere.

WHAT HAPPENED:
[Clear, honest explanation]

IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS:
[How this affects the company, operations, customers]

WHAT WE'RE DOING:
[Response actions, timeline, responsible parties]

YOUR ROLE:
[If customer-facing: talking points]
[If operational: changes to processes]
[All: where to get more information]

WHAT'S NEXT:
[Update schedule, contact for questions]

I know this is concerning, and I appreciate your professionalism and
dedication as we work through this together. We'll get through this.

[Signature]
```

    "customer_reviews": "Star rating trend",
    "employee_reviews": "Glassdoor score"
  },
  "brand_health": {
    "awareness": "Aided/unaided brand recall",
    "consideration": "Purchase consideration",
    "preference": "Brand preference vs competitors",
    "loyalty": "NPS, repeat purchase rate"
  },
  "search": {
    "branded_search": "Search volume trend",
    "search_autocomplete": "Suggested terms",
    "featured_snippets": "Crisis mention in results"
  },

    "customer_acquisition": "New customer rate",
    "customer_retention": "Churn rate",
    "stock_price": "Share performance (public companies)"
  }
}
```

## Legal Considerations

### Disclosure vs. Exposure

**When to Disclose**:
- Legal requirement (regulations, contracts)
- Material impact (shareholders need to know)
- Safety issue (public health concern)
- Media inquiry (going to be published anyway)
- Stakeholder right to know (affected parties)

**When to Limit**:
- Ongoing investigation (prejudice risk)
- Personnel matters (privacy)
- Trade secrets (competitive harm)
- Pending litigation (legal strategy)
- Law enforcement request (compromise investigation)

**Legal Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Defamation risk (naming individuals)
- [ ] Admission of liability
- [ ] Securities disclosure requirements
- [ ] Privacy law compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- [ ] Industry regulations (HIPAA, FERPA, etc.)
- [ ] Contractual obligations
- [ ] Discovery implications (future litigation)

### Crisis Communication Policies

**Document Retention**:
- All crisis communications saved
- Media inquiries and responses logged
- Meeting notes preserved
- Approval chains documented
- Legal holds observed

**Privileged Communications**:
- Attorney-client privilege maintained
- Work product doctrine applied
- Mark "Privileged and Confidential" appropriately
- Limit distribution of legal advice
- Don't waive privilege inadvertently

### Regulatory Notifications

**Common Requirements**:

**Data Breach**:
- State laws: Varies (CA: without unreasonable delay)
- GDPR: 72 hours to supervisory authority
- HIPAA: 60 days to affected individuals
- SEC: Material impact disclosure

**Product Recall**:
- CPSC: Immediately for consumer products
- FDA: Varies by risk class (24 hours for Class I)
- NHTSA: 5 days for vehicles
- USDA: Immediately for food

**Environmental**:
