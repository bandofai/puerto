**Crisis Severity Assessment**:
```markdown
START: Crisis reported

Q1: Does it involve safety/health risk?
├─ YES → Severity: HIGH → Activate immediately
└─ NO → Continue to Q2

Q2: Does it impact >1000 customers/stakeholders?
├─ YES → Severity: HIGH → Activate immediately
└─ NO → Continue to Q3

Q3: Does it involve legal/regulatory violation?
├─ YES → Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH → Activate within 1hr
└─ NO → Continue to Q4

Q4: Does it have media/social media attention?
├─ YES → Severity: MEDIUM → Activate within 4hr
└─ NO → Severity: LOW → Monitor, prepare response plan
```

**Response Strategy Selection** (SCCT):
```markdown
CRISIS TYPE:

Victim Cluster (natural disaster, violence, tampering, rumors)
├─ Low attribution of responsibility
└─ Strategy: Instructing Information + Care Response
    - Provide safety information
    - Express concern for victims
    - Minimal apology needed

Accidental Cluster (technical error, unintentional recalls)
├─ Minimal attribution of responsibility
└─ Strategy: Instructing + Adjusting Information
    - Explain what happened
    - Corrective actions taken
    - Minimal compensation

Preventable Cluster (human error, misconduct, negligence)
├─ Strong attribution of responsibility
└─ Strategy: Rebuilding (Apology + Compensation)
    - Full responsibility
    - Sincere apology
    - Compensation offered
    - Prevention measures
```

**Escalation Procedures**

**Triggers for Escalation**:
1. Safety/health risk identified
2. Legal/regulatory implications discovered
3. Media inquiry from national outlet
4. Social media post >10K engagements
5. Multiple stakeholder groups affected
6. Financial materiality threshold exceeded
7. Executive involvement required

**Escalation Pathway**:
```markdown
Level 1: Communications team handles
  ↓ (if triggers met)
Level 2: Crisis team activated (Comms Lead decision)
  ↓ (if triggers met)
Level 3: Full crisis command (Crisis Commander decision)
  ↓ (if triggers met)
Level 4: Board notification (CEO/Crisis Commander)
  ↓ (if triggers met)
Level 5: External experts engaged (Board decision)
```

**Training and Simulation**
