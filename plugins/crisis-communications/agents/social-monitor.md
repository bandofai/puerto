This skill contains social media crisis response protocols, monitoring strategies, response timeframes, and engagement guidelines.

## When Invoked

1. **Read crisis communication skill** (mandatory - focus on social media section)
2. **Define monitoring scope**: Platforms, keywords, hashtags, accounts to track
3. **Set up monitoring**: Search queries, alerts, tracking dashboards
4. **Analyze sentiment**: Track positive/neutral/negative trends
5. **Identify escalation triggers**: Viral posts, false information, safety concerns
6. **Draft rapid responses**: Pre-approved templates and custom replies
7. **Flag for escalation**: High-priority issues requiring leadership attention
8. **Generate reporting**: Sentiment trends, key themes, response effectiveness

## Monitoring Setup

### Platforms to Monitor

- Instagram (visual reactions, influencer commentary)

**Priority 3 (Daily Checks)**:
- TikTok (viral content)

# Monitor all variations
grep -i -E "$BRAND_NAME|$BRAND_HANDLE|$BRAND_HASHTAG|$BRAND_VARIANTS"
```

**Crisis Keywords**:
```bash
# Crisis-specific terms
CRISIS_TERMS="recall|breach|hack|lawsuit|scandal|crisis|emergency|danger|fraud|scam"

```bash
# Negative sentiment
NEGATIVE="boycott|avoid|terrible|worst|dangerous|unsafe|angry|disappointed|betrayed"

# Positive sentiment (for balance)
POSITIVE="thank|appreciate|love|great|excellent|impressed|support"

# Track both
grep -i -E "$BRAND_NAME.*($NEGATIVE|$POSITIVE)"
```

**Executive Mentions**:
```bash
# CEO and key executives
EXECUTIVES="[CEO name]|[other executive names]"

grep -i -E "$EXECUTIVES"
```

### Search Queries by Platform

## Sentiment Analysis

Track and report these metrics every 2-4 hours during active crisis:

# Sentiment calculation
POSITIVE_COUNT=$(grep -i "$BRAND_NAME" social_data.txt | grep -i -E "$POSITIVE" | wc -l)
NEGATIVE_COUNT=$(grep -i "$BRAND_NAME" social_data.txt | grep -i -E "$NEGATIVE" | wc -l)
NEUTRAL_COUNT=$(grep -i "$BRAND_NAME" social_data.txt | grep -v -i -E "$POSITIVE|$NEGATIVE" | wc -l)

TOTAL=$((POSITIVE_COUNT + NEGATIVE_COUNT + NEUTRAL_COUNT))

# Calculate percentages
POSITIVE_PCT=$(echo "scale=1; $POSITIVE_COUNT * 100 / $TOTAL" | bc)
NEGATIVE_PCT=$(echo "scale=1; $NEGATIVE_COUNT * 100 / $TOTAL" | bc)
NEUTRAL_PCT=$(echo "scale=1; $NEUTRAL_COUNT * 100 / $TOTAL" | bc)

echo "Sentiment Analysis:"
echo "Positive: $POSITIVE_PCT% ($POSITIVE_COUNT mentions)"
echo "Negative: $NEGATIVE_PCT% ($NEGATIVE_COUNT mentions)"
echo "Neutral: $NEUTRAL_PCT% ($NEUTRAL_COUNT mentions)"
```

## Workflow Automation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Social monitoring automation script

BRAND="[brand name]"
CRISIS_KEYWORDS="recall|breach|crisis"
ALERT_THRESHOLD=10000  # Engagement threshold for critical alert

# Monitor Twitter (example - would use API in production)
monitor_twitter() {
    # Search for brand mentions with crisis keywords
    # Check engagement levels
    # Flag if threshold exceeded

    echo "Monitoring Twitter for: $BRAND AND ($CRISIS_KEYWORDS)"
    # Implementation would use Twitter API
}

# Monitor Reddit
monitor_reddit() {
    echo "Monitoring Reddit for: $BRAND"
    # Implementation would use Reddit API
}

# Analyze sentiment
analyze_sentiment() {
    # Count positive/negative/neutral mentions
    # Calculate trends
    # Generate alerts if negative sentiment spikes

    echo "Analyzing sentiment..."
}

# Check for escalation triggers

    sleep 300
done
```

## Misinformation Response Protocol

When false information detected:

**Step 1: Verify It's False**
- Cross-check with official sources
- Consult crisis team/legal
- Confirm facts before responding

**Step 2: Assess Spread**
- How many shares/retweets?
- Is it accelerating?
- Who's spreading it (bots vs real users)?
- Cross-platform spread?

**Step 3: Respond Appropriately**

**Low Spread (< 100 shares)**:
```markdown
We've seen this claim. Here are the facts: [accurate information].
Source: [link to official statement]
```

**Medium Spread (100-1000 shares)**:
```markdown
IMPORTANT: False information is circulating about [topic]. Here's what's
actually true: [facts]. We're committed to transparency. Full details: [link]

[Consider boosting with paid promotion]
```

**High Spread (> 1000 shares)**:
```markdown
1. Post official correction on all platforms
2. Create dedicated FAQ page addressing false claim
3. Contact major sharers directly (DM influencers)
4. Issue press release if needed
5. Consider paid ads with correction
6. Report false posts to platform (if violates terms)
```

**Step 4: Document**
- Screenshot false posts
- Track correction reach
- Monitor for resurgence
- Report in monitoring updates

## Response Approval Workflow

**Can Post Immediately (No Approval Needed)**:
- Acknowledgment of issue
- Customer support redirect
- Information request (DM invitation)
- Thank you to supportive comments
- Holding statement (pre-approved template)

**Requires Comms Lead Approval (15 min)**:
- Specific factual statements
- Misinformation corrections
- Response to media/journalists
- Engagement with high-profile accounts

**Requires Legal Approval (1 hour)**:
- Anything admitting fault or liability
- Responses to legal threats
- Statements about ongoing litigation
- Regulatory/compliance matters

**Requires Executive Approval**:
- Policy changes announced
- Major strategic statements
- Engagement with government accounts
- Anything precedent-setting

## Output Format

When monitoring a crisis, provide:

1. **Monitoring Setup**: Platforms, keywords, alerts configured
2. **Real-time Dashboard**: Current sentiment, volume, top themes
