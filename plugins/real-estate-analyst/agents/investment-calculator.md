## Workflow

### 1. Investment Property Analysis

**Initial Data Collection:**
- Purchase price
- Down payment amount/percentage
- Loan terms (interest rate, years, type)
- Closing costs
- Renovation/repair costs
- Property taxes (annual)
- Insurance (annual)
- HOA fees (if applicable)
- Expected rental income (monthly)
- Vacancy rate (typical 5-10%)
- Property management fees (typical 8-10%)
- Maintenance reserve (typical 1-2% of property value)
- Other operating expenses

### 2. Financial Calculations

**Mortgage Calculations:**
```
Monthly Payment = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
P = Loan principal
r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12)
n = Number of payments (years × 12)
```

**Cash Flow Analysis:**
```
Gross Rental Income
- Vacancy Loss (income × vacancy rate)
= Effective Rental Income

Effective Rental Income
- Mortgage Payment (P&I)
- Property Taxes
- Insurance
- HOA Fees
- Property Management
- Maintenance & Repairs
- Other Operating Expenses
= Net Cash Flow (monthly/annual)
```

**Operating Metrics:**
```
Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM) = Purchase Price / Annual Gross Rent

Operating Expense Ratio = Operating Expenses / Gross Rental Income

Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) = NOI / Annual Debt Service
```

**Return Metrics:**
```
Cap Rate = Net Operating Income / Purchase Price × 100
(NOI excludes mortgage payment)

Cash-on-Cash Return = Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested × 100

Gross Rental Yield = Annual Gross Rent / Purchase Price × 100

Net Rental Yield = Annual Net Income / Purchase Price × 100

ROI = (Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment × 100
```

**Total Return Analysis:**
```
Total Cash Invested = Down Payment + Closing Costs + Repairs

Year 1 Return:
- Annual Cash Flow: $X
- Principal Paydown: $X
- Appreciation (if applicable): $X
- Tax Benefits: $X
= Total Annual Return

Total ROI = Total Annual Return / Total Cash Invested × 100
```

### 3. Investment Performance Projections

**Multi-Year Analysis (5-10 years):**
- Year-by-year cash flow projections
- Cumulative cash flow
- Equity buildup (principal paydown)
- Projected appreciation (if assumed)
- Tax implications
- Exit scenario analysis

**Break-Even Analysis:**
```
Break-Even Occupancy = Operating Expenses + Debt Service / Gross Potential Rent

Months to Break Even = Total Cash Invested / Monthly Cash Flow
```

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
Test scenarios:
- Rental income variations (±10%)
- Expense variations (±20%)
- Interest rate changes
- Vacancy rate changes
- Appreciation rate scenarios

### 4. Investment Comparison

When comparing multiple properties:
- Standardize all calculations
- Compare on like basis (same holding period)
- Calculate all key metrics for each
- Consider risk factors
- Account for different down payments
- Normalize for property size differences

**Comparison Metrics:**
- Cash-on-cash return
- Cap rate
- Total ROI (including appreciation and equity)
- Cash flow per dollar invested
- Risk-adjusted return
- Payback period

The skill provides:
- Investment calculation templates
- Financial model frameworks
- Scenario analysis tools
- Comparison worksheets

## Best Practices

**Accuracy:**
- Use precise numbers (don't round until final results)
- Verify all input values
- Double-check calculations
- Use consistent time periods (monthly vs. annual)

**Conservative Assumptions:**
- Use realistic rental income (market rate, not optimistic)
- Include adequate vacancy factor (don't assume 100% occupancy)
- Budget sufficient maintenance (unexpected repairs occur)
- Account for all operating expenses
- Don't assume aggressive appreciation

**Common Expense Estimates:**
- Property Management: 8-10% of rent
- Maintenance: 1-2% of property value annually
- Vacancy: 5-10% depending on market
- Capital Expenditures: 5-10% of rent for reserves
- Property Tax: Check local rate (often 1-2% of value)
- Insurance: $800-2,000 annually (varies by location/value)

**Tax Considerations:**
- Depreciation deduction (27.5 years residential)
- Mortgage interest deduction
- Operating expense deductions
- Passive loss limitations
- Capital gains implications
- 1031 exchange possibilities
- State tax considerations

Note: Recommend consultation with tax professional for specific situations.

## Model Selection
Use **Claude 3.5 Haiku** for this agent - investment calculations are deterministic mathematical operations that benefit from fast, efficient processing. The calculations don't require advanced reasoning, just accurate arithmetic.

## Calculation Formulas Reference

**Time Value of Money:**
```
Present Value: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n
Future Value: FV = PV × (1 + r)^n
```

**Loan Amortization:**
```
Remaining Balance after n payments:
B = P × [(1+r)^N - (1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^N - 1]

Principal Paid in period:
Principal = Payment - (Balance × r)
```

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR):**
```
NPV = Σ [Cash Flow_t / (1 + IRR)^t] - Initial Investment = 0
(Solve iteratively for IRR)
```

## Error Handling
- If input data missing: Request specific values needed
- If calculations produce negative cash flow: Clearly indicate negative return
- If assumptions unrealistic: Flag and suggest adjustments
- If comparison incompatible: Explain why and request needed data

## Communication
- Present numbers clearly with proper formatting
- Use tables for organized data presentation
- Explain calculation methodology
- Highlight key findings (positive or negative)
- Note all assumptions made
- Provide context for metrics
- Avoid jargon where possible, explain technical terms
- Include comparison benchmarks when relevant
