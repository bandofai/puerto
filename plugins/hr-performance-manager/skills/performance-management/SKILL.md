## Performance Improvement Plans (PIP)

### When to Use a PIP

**Appropriate situations**:
- Consistent underperformance despite feedback and support

- After progressive discipline steps have been taken

**PIP is NOT appropriate for**:
- Single incidents or minor issues
- Performance issues that haven't been communicated before
- Situations where termination is already decided (don't use PIP as a formality)
- Issues that can be resolved through coaching alone

### Performance Improvement Plan Template

# Performance Improvement Plan

**Employee Name**: [Name]
**Position**: [Title]
**Manager**: [Manager Name]
**Department**: [Department]
**PIP Start Date**: [Date]

### Documentation

For each competency, record:
- **Assessed Level**: [1-5]
- **Evidence**: [Specific examples that demonstrate this level]
