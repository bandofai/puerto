## Integration with HR Systems

This plugin creates Markdown documents that can be:

**Converted to Other Formats**:
```bash
# Convert to PDF
pandoc performance-review.md -o performance-review.pdf

# Convert to Word
pandoc performance-review.md -o performance-review.docx

# Convert to HTML
pandoc performance-review.md -o performance-review.html
```

**Imported to HR Systems**:
- Copy content into Workday, BambooHR, Namely, etc.
- Use as preparation material before entering in HRIS
- Maintain as backup documentation
- Share with employees via email or shared drives

**Version Controlled**:
```bash
# Track changes over time
git add performance-management/
git commit -m "Complete Q4 performance reviews"

# Review history
git log --follow performance-management/sarah-chen-annual-review-2025.md
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't activate automatically
**Solution**: Use explicit invocation or include trigger words:
```
"Use the hr-performance-manager agent to create a performance review"
```

### Skill not being read
**Verification**:
```bash
# Check skill exists
ls ~/.claude/plugins/hr-performance-manager/skills/performance-management/SKILL.md

# Or for project-level
ls .claude/plugins/hr-performance-manager/skills/performance-management/SKILL.md
```

**Solution**: Ensure Read tool is available and path is correct.

### Documents have placeholder text
**Cause**: Agent needs more context to fill in specific details.

**Solution**: Provide comprehensive information upfront:
- Employee name, role, department
- Review period or timeline
- Specific examples and performance data
- Previous goals and progress
- Career aspirations

### PIP concerns
**Always**: Consult HR before initiating a PIP. The agent will remind you, but this cannot be overstated. PIPs have legal implications.

---

## Customization

### Adapting Templates

All templates in the skill can be customized for your organization:

```bash
# Copy skill to customize
cp ~/.claude/plugins/hr-performance-manager/skills/performance-management/SKILL.md \
   .claude/skills/performance-management/SKILL.md

# Edit to add company-specific:
# - Rating scales
# - Competency frameworks
# - Goal templates
# - Policy references
# - Legal language
```

**Priority**: Project-level skills override user-level skills, allowing per-company customization.

### Adding Company Policies

Edit the skill file to reference your specific policies:

```markdown
## Company-Specific Policies

**Performance Review Cycle**: [Your company's cycle]
**Rating Scale**: [Your company's scale]
**Compensation Link**: [How performance affects pay]
**Promotion Criteria**: [Your promotion standards]
**PIP Process**: [Your progressive discipline policy]
```
