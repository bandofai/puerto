## Important Guidelines

### Performance Reviews

**DO**:
- ✅ Use specific, dated examples
- ✅ Use the full rating scale (avoid rating everyone "3")
- ✅ Balance positive feedback with developmental feedback
- ✅ Link performance to business impact
- ✅ Set clear, measurable goals for next period
- ✅ Involve employee in self-assessment
- ✅ Document discussions and agreements

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Use vague language ("good job," "needs work")
- ❌ Surprise employees with feedback not previously shared
- ❌ Let recency bias dominate (consider full review period)
- ❌ Compare employees to each other (compare to standards)
- ❌ Make it about personality (focus on behaviors/outcomes)
- ❌ Rush through the process

---

### Goal Setting

**DO**:
- ✅ Align goals with company/team objectives (cascade)
- ✅ Make goals specific and measurable
- ✅ Set challenging but achievable targets
- ✅ Include both results goals and development goals
- ✅ Revisit quarterly and adjust if needed
- ✅ Celebrate wins

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Set goals once and forget them
- ❌ Make goals too easy or impossibly hard
- ❌ Use only activity metrics (focus on outcomes)
- ❌ Ignore changing business priorities
- ❌ Penalize for missing goals due to changed priorities

---

### Career Development

**DO**:
- ✅ Have regular career conversations (quarterly minimum)
- ✅ Create written development plans
- ✅ Provide stretch assignments
- ✅ Be transparent about growth paths
- ✅ Support career goals even outside current team

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Wait for annual review to discuss careers
- ❌ Promise promotions you can't deliver
- ❌ Ignore employees' stated aspirations
- ❌ Block internal transfers due to self-interest
- ❌ Let development plans collect dust

---

### PIPs

**DO**:
- ✅ Consult HR BEFORE initiating
- ✅ Use specific, objective examples
- ✅ Focus on behaviors and outcomes
- ✅ Provide genuine support and resources
- ✅ Document everything thoroughly
- ✅ Follow up consistently as promised
- ✅ Give fair opportunity to improve

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Use PIP as a surprise (should follow documented feedback)
- ❌ Make success criteria impossible to achieve
- ❌ Use PIP as formality when termination is decided
- ❌ Reduce support during PIP period
- ❌ Discuss PIP with other team members
- ❌ Skip HR involvement

---

## Handling Edge Cases

### No Previous Performance Data
If this is first review or no prior documentation exists:
1. Focus on observable performance during current period
2. Set baseline for future reviews
3. Establish clear expectations going forward
4. Use competency framework for structure
5. Gather input from peers/stakeholders

### Employee Disputes Rating
If employee disagrees with assessment:
1. Listen to their perspective fully
2. Ask for specific examples supporting their view
3. Review evidence together
4. Remain objective and fact-based
5. Allow employee to add written comments to review
6. Involve HR if significant disagreement
7. Remember: signature means receipt, not agreement

### Underperformance After Life Events
For performance issues related to personal circumstances:
1. Show empathy and support
2. Discuss available resources (EAP, leave policies)
3. Create reasonable accommodation if needed
4. Set clear expectations while being flexible on timeline
5. Document conversations about support provided
6. Consult HR about legal obligations (FMLA, ADA, etc.)

### Remote/Hybrid Employee Reviews
For distributed team members:
1. Track contributions in visible ways (documentation, updates)
2. Use collaboration tool data (commits, tickets, etc.)
3. Gather stakeholder feedback proactively
4. Schedule video calls for important discussions
5. Be mindful of time zones
6. Don't penalize for lack of "visibility" (focus on outcomes)

### High Performer Leaving
For retention-critical employees considering departure:
1. Understand root cause (compensation, growth, manager, role)
2. Be honest about what can/can't change
3. Explore internal opportunities if appropriate
4. Don't make promises you can't keep
5. If they leave, conduct thoughtful exit interview
6. Part on good terms (boomerang employees are valuable)

## Integration with Other HR Processes
