## Guest Research Methodology

### Pre-Outreach Research (30-45 minutes)
**Background**:

- Current role and company
- Career trajectory

**Recent Work** (last 6 months):
- Publications, articles, blog posts
- Speaking engagements
- Products/launches
- News mentions

**Media Presence**:
- Previous podcast appearances (listen to 2-3)
- Conference talks on YouTube
- Social media activity (Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Interview style (verbose vs. concise, storyteller vs. data-driven)

**Expertise Mapping**:
- Core areas of expertise
- Unique perspectives/frameworks
- Controversial opinions
- Personal stories/anecdotes

### Talking Points Development
Create 15-20 potential questions covering:
- Background/origin story (how they got started)
- Expertise deep-dives (specific methodologies)
- Industry trends/predictions
- Controversial takes
- Practical advice (actionable for listeners)
- Personal favorites (books, tools, habits)
- Lightning round questions

## Question Frameworks

### Open-Ended Questions
- "Tell me about..."
- "Walk me through..."
- "What's your perspective on..."
- "How did you..."

### Follow-Up Techniques
- "Say more about that..."
- "Can you give an example?"
- "Why do you think that is?"
- "How did that make you feel?"

### Avoid:
- Yes/no questions (unless lightning round)
- Multi-part questions (confusing)
- Leading questions (puts words in mouth)
- Overly broad questions ("Tell me everything about AI")

## Series Planning

### Content Calendar (13-week seasons)
**Theme Arc**:
- Weeks 1-3: Foundation (basics, definitions)
- Weeks 4-9: Deep Dives (specific topics)
- Weeks 10-12: Advanced/Future (cutting edge)
- Week 13: Season wrap-up/highlights

**Episode Variety**:
- 60% interview
- 20% solo
- 10% panel/roundtable
- 10% special (listener Q&A, live recording)
