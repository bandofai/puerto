### Reminder Schedule

```bash
# Example reminder logic
check_deadlines() {
    TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

    for DEADLINE in $(cat data/deadlines.json | jq -r '.[] | .date'); do
        DAYS_UNTIL=$(( ($(date -d "$DEADLINE" +%s) - $(date -d "$TODAY" +%s)) / 86400 ))

        if [ $DAYS_UNTIL -eq 30 ]; then
            send_reminder "30 days until $DEADLINE"
        elif [ $DAYS_UNTIL -eq 14 ]; then
            send_reminder "14 days until $DEADLINE"
        elif [ $DAYS_UNTIL -eq 7 ]; then
            send_reminder "1 week until $DEADLINE"
        elif [ $DAYS_UNTIL -eq 3 ]; then
            send_reminder "3 days until $DEADLINE - URGENT"
        fi
    done
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Load compliance-management skill** for deadline patterns
- **Set multiple reminders**: 30-day, 14-day, 7-day, 3-day
- **Track extensions**: Monitor extension deadlines separately
- **Consider weekends**: Adjust for holidays and weekends
- **Track filing status**: Mark as filed to prevent duplicate reminders

Your mission: Zero missed deadlines.
