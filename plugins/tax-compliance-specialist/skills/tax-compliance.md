#### 3. Married Filing Separately

- Failure-to-pay penalty: 0.5% per month (max 25%)
- Extension filing prevents failure-to-file penalty (5% per month)

### Common Extension Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Not paying tax owed**
- Extension to file ≠ extension to pay
- Must pay estimated tax by April 15
- Solution: Estimate and pay at least 90% of tax owed

**Mistake 2: Missing extension deadline**
- Extension request must be filed by April 15
- Solution: Set calendar reminder for April 1

**Mistake 3: Not filing by October 15**
- Extension only gives until October 15
- Failure-to-file penalty resumes after October 15
- Solution: Mark October 1 deadline to complete return

**Mistake 4: Assuming state automatically extends**
- Some states require separate extension filing
- Solution: Check state tax authority website

**Mistake 5: Not keeping extension confirmation**
- Need proof extension was filed if IRS questions
- Solution: Save electronic confirmation or certified mail receipt

### Extension Best Practices

1. **File early**: Don't wait until April 15
2. **Overestimate payment**: Better to get refund than owe penalty
3. **Keep records**: Save confirmation and payment proof
4. **Don't procrastinate**: Extension is for filing, not preparation
5. **Gather documents**: Use extension time to collect all forms
6. **Consider professional help**: If complex situation, hire CPA

# Deductions & Credits

## Overview

Deductions reduce taxable income (saving you tax at your marginal rate), while credits reduce tax owed dollar-for-dollar. Understanding which deductions and credits you qualify for is essential to minimizing tax liability legally.

## Standard vs Itemized Deduction Decision

### Standard Deduction Amounts (2024)

**Single**: $14,600
**Married Filing Jointly**: $29,200
**Married Filing Separately**: $14,600
**Head of Household**: $21,900
**Qualifying Surviving Spouse**: $29,200

**Additional Amounts**:
- Age 65+: Add $1,950 (single/HOH) or $1,550 (married)
- Blind: Add $1,950 (single/HOH) or $1,550 (married)
- Both 65+ and blind: Add both amounts

**Example**: Married filing jointly, both age 68
- Base standard deduction: $29,200
- Age 65+ addition (×2): $3,100
- Total standard deduction: $32,300

### When to Itemize

**Itemize if**:
- Total itemized deductions > standard deduction
- Married filing separately and spouse itemizes (must both itemize)
- You were a nonresident or dual-status alien

**Common Scenarios Favoring Itemization**:
- High state and local taxes (subject to $10K cap)
- Large mortgage interest on home loan
- Significant charitable contributions
- Major medical expenses (over 7.5% AGI)
- Casualty or theft losses from federally declared disaster

### Itemization Strategy

**Bunching Deductions**:
- Alternate between itemizing and standard deduction
- Bunch two years of charitable donations into one year
- Time medical procedures to maximize deduction

**Example**:
- Year 1: Make $20K charitable donation, itemize
- Year 2: Take standard deduction
- Better than $10K donation each year if each year is under standard deduction threshold

**State Tax Considerations**:
- Some states don't allow standard deduction
- May need to itemize state even if taking standard federal
- Calculate both federal and state tax impact

## Digital vs Paper Record Keeping

### Digital Record Keeping Advantages

- Automatic backups possible

**IRS Acceptance**:
- IRS accepts digital records

- Must maintain system to reproduce documents

### How to Digitize

**Scanning Options**:
- Smartphone scanner apps (Adobe Scan, Genius Scan, etc.)
- Flatbed scanner
- Document feeder scanner (for bulk)

**Best Practices**:
- Scan receipts when received (thermal paper fades)
- Use PDF format (widely accepted)
- Name files clearly: "2024-01-15_Medical_DrSmith_150.pdf"
- Organize in folders by year and category

**Cloud Storage**:
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- Microsoft OneDrive
- iCloud
- Encrypted storage for sensitive docs

**Backup Strategy**:
- 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite
- Example: Computer + external drive + cloud

### Paper Record Keeping

**Pros**:
- Don't need technology to access
- Some feel more secure
- Original signature documents

**Organization System**:
- File folders by year
- Subdivide by category (income, deductions, etc.)
- Tax returns separate from supporting documents

**Storage**:
- Fireproof safe for current year
- Storage boxes for older years
- Climate-controlled (prevent deterioration)

**Label Clearly**:
- Year on outside of box/folder
- Contents list
- Destruction date

### Hybrid Approach

**Best of Both**:
- Keep paper originals for critical documents
- Scan everything for daily access
- Store originals securely

**What to Keep in Original**:
- Signed contracts
- Property deeds
- Stock certificates (if not electronic)
- Original wills and estate documents

**What Digital Is Fine**:
- Receipts
- Bank statements
- Utility bills
- Most routine documents

Quarterly estimated taxes are required for income not subject to withholding. Failure to pay can result in penalties, even if you file and pay on time at year-end.

## Who Needs to Pay Estimated Taxes

### General Rule

**Must pay estimated taxes if BOTH**:
1. Expect to owe at least $1,000 in tax after subtracting withholding and credits
2. Expect withholding and credits to be less than smaller of:
   - 90% of current year tax, OR
   - 100% of prior year tax (110% if AGI over $150K, $75K if MFS)

### Common Situations Requiring Estimated Taxes

**Self-Employed**:
- Freelancers, contractors, consultants
- No employer withholding
- Must pay both income tax and self-employment tax

**Business Owners**:
- Sole proprietors (Schedule C)
- Partners in partnership
- S-corporation shareholders (on non-wage income)

**Investors**:
- Significant investment income
- Rental property income
- Capital gains from selling investments/property

**Retirees**:
- IRA/401k distributions (if no or low withholding)
- Pension income (if no or low withholding)
- Social Security may become taxable

**High Income Earners**:
- Bonuses and commissions
- Stock options exercised
- If withholding not adjusted to cover

**Multiple Jobs**:
- Combined income pushes into higher bracket
- Each employer withholds based on that job only

### Who Generally Doesn't Need to Pay

**W-2 Employee**:
- Single job with proper withholding
- No significant outside income

**Low Income**:
- Tax liability under $1,000 after withholding

**Sufficient Withholding**:
- Withholding covers 90% of current year or 100%/110% of prior year

### Special Rules

**Farmers and Fishermen**:
- Different rules (2/3 of income from farming/fishing)
- Can file and pay by March 1 instead of quarterly
- Or pay one estimated payment by January 15

**Nonresident Aliens**:
- Must pay estimated tax
- Different forms (1040-ES(NR))

**Household Employers**:
- May owe household employment tax
- Can pay quarterly or with personal return (Schedule H)

## Safe Harbor Rules

Safe harbor means you won't owe underpayment penalty, even if you owe tax when you file.

### Three Safe Harbor Options

#### Option 1: 90% of Current Year Tax

**Requirement**: Pay at least 90% of current year's tax liability

**Pros**:
- Minimizes estimated payments if income decreases
- Good for declining income year

**Cons**:
- Don't know final tax until year ends
- Risk of underpaying if income higher than expected

**Example**:
- Current year tax: $20,000
- Must pay at least: $18,000 (90% × $20,000)
- If withholding + estimates >= $18,000, no penalty

#### Option 2: 100% of Prior Year Tax

**Requirement**: Pay at least 100% of prior year's tax liability (total tax on line 24 of Form 1040)

**Pros**:
- Know exact amount needed
- Safe even if current year income much higher
- Simple calculation

**Cons**:
- May overpay if income decreases
- Not available if no prior year return

**Example**:
- Prior year tax: $15,000
- Must pay at least: $15,000
- If withholding + estimates >= $15,000, no penalty
- Even if current year tax is $25,000

#### Option 3: 110% of Prior Year Tax (High Income)

**Requirement**: If prior year AGI over $150,000 ($75,000 if MFS), must pay 110% of prior year tax

**Why Higher**:
- High earners expected to pay more
- Prevents wealthy from underpaying

**Example**:
- Prior year AGI: $200,000
- Prior year tax: $40,000
- Must pay at least: $44,000 (110% × $40,000)

### Which Safe Harbor to Use

**Use 100%/110% of Prior Year If**:
- Want certainty
- Income similar or increasing
- Don't want to calculate current year projections

**Use 90% of Current Year If**:
- Income decreasing significantly
- Want to minimize payments
- Willing to estimate accurately

**Example Comparison**:
- Prior year tax: $30,000
- Prior year AGI: $120,000 (use 100% safe harbor)
- Current year estimated tax: $20,000 (income decreased)

Option 1 (90% current): $18,000 (0.90 × $20,000)
Option 2 (100% prior): $30,000

**Choose Option 1** to avoid overpaying

**If Income Increasing**:
- Prior year tax: $30,000
- Current year estimated tax: $50,000

Option 1 (90% current): $45,000 (0.90 × $50,000)
Option 2 (100% prior): $30,000

**Choose Option 2** for certainty (but may owe $20,000 more at filing)

## Calculation Methods

### Method 1: Simple Estimation

**Steps**:
1. Estimate total income for year
2. Subtract deductions and exemptions
3. Calculate tax on taxable income
4. Add self-employment tax (if applicable)
5. Subtract withholding and credits
6. Divide by 4 quarters

**Example**:
- Estimated income: $80,000 (self-employed)
- Standard deduction: $14,600
- Taxable income: $65,400
- Income tax: ~$9,200
- Self-employment tax: ~$11,300 (15.3% of 92.35% of $80,000)
- Total tax: $20,500
- Withholding: $0
- Quarterly payment: $5,125 ($20,500 ÷ 4)

### Method 2: Prior Year Safe Harbor

**Steps**:
1. Find total tax from prior year Form 1040, line 24
2. Multiply by 100% (or 110% if high income)
3. Subtract expected withholding
4. Divide by 4 quarters

**Example**:
- Prior year tax (line 24): $18,000
- Prior year AGI: $90,000 (use 100%)
- Safe harbor amount: $18,000
- Expected withholding: $6,000
- Annual estimated payments needed: $12,000
- Quarterly payment: $3,000 ($12,000 ÷ 4)

### Method 3: Annualized Income Installment

**For Uneven Income**: Income varies significantly by quarter

**Use Form 2210, Schedule AI**:
- Calculate tax based on actual income each period
- Pay proportional amount each quarter
- More complex but accurate for fluctuating income

**Example**:
- Q1: $10,000 income
- Q2: $15,000 income
- Q3: $60,000 income (big contract)
- Q4: $15,000 income

Instead of equal quarterly payments, pay more in Q3 when income higher.

**When to Use**:
- Seasonal businesses
- Large one-time income events (bonus, stock sale)
- Commission-based income

### Self-Employment Tax Calculation

**Self-Employment Tax Rate**: 15.3%
- Social Security: 12.4% on first $160,200 (2023), $168,600 (2024)
- Medicare: 2.9% on all income
- Additional Medicare: 0.9% on income over $200K (single) / $250K (joint)

**Calculation**:
1. Net self-employment income × 92.35%
2. Result × 15.3% = SE tax
3. For estimated tax: Include full SE tax amount

**Example**:
- Net self-employment income: $80,000
- $80,000 × 92.35% = $73,880
- $73,880 × 15.3% = $11,304 SE tax

**Note**: Half of SE tax is deductible (on Schedule 1)

### Late Payment and Underpayment Penalties

**Failure to Pay Estimated Tax**:

**Underpayment Penalty**:
- Form 2210 calculates penalty
- Applied even if you get refund at year-end
- Based on how late and how much underpaid

**Penalty Exceptions**:
- Met one of the safe harbors
- Total tax less than $1,000 after withholding
- No tax liability prior year and citizen/resident for full year
- Casualty, disaster, or unusual circumstances
- Retired (62+) or disabled and reasonable cause

**How to Avoid Penalty**:
1. Meet safe harbor (easiest)
2. Increase withholding (if have W-2 income)
3. Make catch-up payment if underestimated
4. Use annualized income method if irregular income

### Adjusting Estimated Payments

**Income Changed**:
- Recalculate estimated tax
- Adjust future payments
- Can skip payment if no longer needed

**Underpaid Early Quarters**:
- Can "catch up" in later quarters
- Make larger payment to meet annual safe harbor

**Overpaid**:
- Continue smaller payments
- Or skip remaining quarters
- Get refund at filing

**Using Withholding to Cover**:
- If have W-2 job, increase withholding
- Withholding treated as paid evenly throughout year (unlike estimates)
- Can avoid underpayment penalty even if adjusted late in year

**Example**:
- September: Realized underestimated income
- Increase W-4 withholding for Oct-Dec
- Withholding treated as if paid all year
- Avoids penalty for earlier quarters

### Record Keeping for Quarterly Taxes

**What to Keep**:

- Payment confirmations or cancelled checks
- Date and amount of each payment
- Correspondence with IRS

**Why Important**:
- Prove you made payments if IRS questions
- Calculate penalty if underpaid
- Estimate next year's payments
- Prepare tax return

**Tax Return**:
- Estimated payments go on Form 1040, line 26
- Must match IRS records
- Discrepancies can delay refund

### Best Practices for Quarterly Taxes
