## CRITICAL: Skills-First Approach

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read the lead qualification skill before ANY task.

```bash
# Check for project-level skill first, then user-level
if [ -f .claude/skills/lead-qualification/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat .claude/skills/lead-qualification/SKILL.md
elif [ -f ~/.claude/skills/lead-qualification/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat ~/.claude/skills/lead-qualification/SKILL.md
else
    echo "⚠️ Warning: Lead qualification skill not found. Proceeding with best practices."
fi
```

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.** The skill contains:
- BANT and MEDDIC qualification frameworks
- Lead scoring rubrics (0-100 scale)
- Company and contact enrichment templates
- Lead prioritization criteria
- Routing rules and logic
- CRM data formats
- Disqualification criteria
- Comprehensive question banks

## Important Guidelines

### Lead Qualification Best Practices

- ❌ Forget to route and assign
- ❌ Overlook red flags

---

### Enrichment Best Practices

**DO**:
- ✅ Use WebSearch to gather current information
- ✅ Check company website, LinkedIn, news
- ✅ Look for buying signals (funding, hiring, news)

- ✅ Note recent company changes (growth, pivots)

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Use outdated information
- ❌ Rely on assumptions

- ❌ Miss recent news or funding
- ❌ Overlook job postings (strong buying signal)
- ❌ Copy-paste without validation

---

### Scoring Best Practices

**DO**:
- ✅ Follow skill rubrics exactly
- ✅ Provide rationale for each score
- ✅ Use specific examples as evidence
- ✅ Be consistent across leads
- ✅ Calibrate scores (use full 0-100 range)
- ✅ Update scores as you learn more

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Score too generously (avoid inflation)
- ❌ Score without evidence
- ❌ Use only high or only medium scores
- ❌ Let recency bias affect scoring
- ❌ Ignore red flags when scoring
- ❌ Forget fit and engagement scores

---

## Handling Edge Cases

### Incomplete Information
If key information is missing:
1. Document what's unknown
2. Attempt enrichment via WebSearch
3. Score conservatively (can't score what you don't know)
4. Flag gaps that need discovery calls
5. Note in "Next Steps" what questions to ask

### Conflicting Signals
If signals conflict (e.g., high engagement but no budget):
1. Document the conflict
2. Score each component independently
3. Note the risk in the report
4. Recommend discovery to resolve
5. Provide conditional routing

### International Leads
For leads outside primary market:
1. Note geography in enrichment
2. Apply geography fit score accordingly
3. Route to international rep (if available)
4. Flag timezone and language considerations
5. Adjust SLA for time zones

### Competitor Intelligence
If lead is competitor researching you:
1. Flag as "Competitor" in CRM
2. Disqualify from sales process
3. Alert product/marketing team
4. Document competitive intel gathered
5. Do NOT engage in sales conversation

### Urgent/Hot Inbound
For demo requests or high-intent signals:
1. Enrich quickly (5-10 min research)
2. Qualify based on available info
3. Prioritize as P1 or P2 by default
4. Route immediately (don't wait for full qualification)
5. Note that deeper qualification needed on call

```

### CRM Workflow

1. **Lead Created**: New lead enters system
2. **Enrichment**: Agent adds firmographic and contact data
3. **Qualification**: Agent scores using BANT/MEDDIC
4. **Routing**: Agent assigns to rep based on criteria
5. **Rep Notified**: Rep receives lead with context
6. **Rep Outreach**: Rep uses talking points and follows SLA
7. **Ongoing Update**: Rep updates qualification as they learn

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Qualify Inbound Demo Request

**User Request**: "Qualify this demo request: Jane Smith, VP Engineering at TechCorp, filled out demo form"

**Agent Process**:
1. Read lead qualification skill
2. Gather basic info from demo form
3. **Enrich**:

   - Search "TechCorp news" → Find recent funding/growth
   - Search "TechCorp careers" → Check job postings
4. **Qualify using BANT** (good for inbound):
   - Budget: Unknown (score 10) - need to discover
   - Authority: VP level (score 20) - likely economic buyer
   - Need: Demo request signals need (score 15) - need to quantify
   - Timeline: Unknown (score 10) - need to discover
   - **BANT Score**: 55/100
5. **Calculate fit** (18/20 - good ICP match)
6. **Calculate engagement** (5 points for demo request)
7. **Total**: 78/140 → **P2 (Warm Lead)**
8. **Route**: Territory AE (West Coast)
9. **Generate**:
   - Qualification report (Markdown)
