- **Company Size**: BigCorp = Enterprise (>1000 employees)
- **Geography**: NYC = East Coast territory
- **Title**: CTO = Technical buyer, enterprise deal
- **Score**: If high score â†’ Senior rep

**Routing Logic**:
```
IF Score >= 100 AND Size = Enterprise
  â†’ Senior Enterprise AE

ELSE IF Size >= 1000 employees
  â†’ Enterprise AE for territory

ELSE IF Size = 100-1000
  â†’ Mid-Market AE

ELSE IF Size < 100
  â†’ SMB Rep
```

**What You Get**:

---

### 7. Disqualification Handling

```

Subject: Re: [Solution] for [Company]

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your interest in [Solution]. After reviewing your needs,
I want to be upfront that we may not be the best fit at this time.

[Specific reason: e.g., "We specialize in mid-market companies (100-1000
employees), and you might find better value with solutions tailored for
smaller teams."]

I'd recommend checking out [Alternative 1] or [Alternative 2].

If your situation changes (e.g., you scale to 100+ employees), feel free
to reach out anytime.

Best of luck!
[Your Name]
```

## Framework Comparison

### When to Use BANT vs. MEDDIC

**Use BANT When**:
- Transactional sales (< $50K)
- Shorter sales cycles (< 3 months)
- SMB and mid-market segments
- Clear product-market fit
- Simple buying process
- Single decision maker

**Use MEDDIC When**:
- Enterprise sales (> $100K)
- Complex sales cycles (> 3 months)
- Multiple stakeholders
- Technical evaluations and POCs
- Committee-based decisions
- Strategic, transformational deals

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Start with BANT for quick qualification
- Transition to MEDDIC for deals that grow in scope
- Use BANT for initial lead scoring, MEDDIC for deep qualification

---

## Integration with Sales Tools

### Salesforce Integration

```bash
# Export CRM data in Salesforce format
"Generate Salesforce CSV for these qualified leads"

# Fields mapped:
# - First Name, Last Name, Title, Email, Phone
# - Company, Website, Industry, Employees, Revenue
# - Lead Source, Lead Score, Priority
# - Owner (routing assignment)
# - Description (qualification summary)
```

### HubSpot Integration

```bash
# Export in HubSpot format
"Generate HubSpot CSV with lifecycle stage and lead score"

# Mapping:
# - Contact properties
# - Company properties
# - Custom properties for BANT/MEDDIC scores
# - Lifecycle stage based on priority
```

### API Integration

```json
// JSON format for API imports
{
  "leads": [
    {
      "contact": {...},
      "company": {...},
      "qualification": {...},
      "priority": "P1",
      "assigned_to": "rep@company.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't activate automatically
**Solution**: Use explicit invocation:
```
"Use the sales-lead-qualifier agent to qualify this lead"
```

### Enrichment data is limited
**Cause**: Company has minimal online presence or private information.
**Solution**: Agent will document what's unavailable and flag for manual research.

### Scores seem too low/high
**Cause**: Incomplete information or different scoring expectations.
**Solution**: Review skill rubrics, provide more context, calibrate with team.

### Routing doesn't match expectations
**Cause**: Routing logic doesn't match your specific rules.
**Solution**: Customize routing rules in skill file (`.claude/skills/lead-qualification/SKILL.md`).

### Need to customize for industry
**Solution**: Copy skill to project level and add industry-specific criteria:
```bash
cp ~/.claude/plugins/sales-lead-qualifier/skills/lead-qualification/SKILL.md \
   .claude/skills/lead-qualification/SKILL.md

# Edit to add:
# - Industry-specific qualification questions
# - Custom scoring rubrics
# - Vertical-specific routing rules
```

---

## Customization

### Adapting to Your Sales Process

All templates in the skill can be customized:

```bash
# Copy skill to customize
cp ~/.claude/plugins/sales-lead-qualifier/skills/lead-qualification/SKILL.md \
   .claude/skills/lead-qualification/SKILL.md

# Customize for your company:
# - Adjust scoring rubrics
# - Add custom qualification criteria
# - Define your routing rules
# - Add industry-specific questions
# - Set your priority thresholds
```

**Priority**: Project-level skills override user-level, allowing per-company customization.

### Custom Routing Rules

Edit the skill to define your routing:

```markdown
## Custom Routing Rules

IF Company Size >= 1000 AND Score >= 90
  â†’ Route to: Alice (Enterprise AE, West)

ELSE IF Industry = "Healthcare" AND Score >= 70
  â†’ Route to: Bob (Healthcare Specialist)

ELSE IF Geography = "EU"
  â†’ Route to: Carol (EMEA Team)

ELSE
  â†’ Route to: Round-robin (US Team)
```
