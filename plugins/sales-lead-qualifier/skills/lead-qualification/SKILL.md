## BANT Framework

**BANT** = Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline

### Overview

BANT is a classic qualification framework focusing on four critical factors. It's ideal for transactional sales and shorter sales cycles.

**When to Use BANT**:
- Transactional sales (< $50K deals)
- Shorter sales cycles (< 3 months)
- Clear product-market fit
- SMB and mid-market segments
- When budget is a key constraint

---

### B - Budget

**Definition**: Does the prospect have the financial resources to buy?

**Key Questions**:
- What is your budget for this type of solution?
- Have you allocated budget for this project?
- What budget range are you working within?
- When was the budget approved?
- Who controls the budget?

**Scoring Criteria**:

| Score | Budget Status | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| 25 | Budget Confirmed | Explicit budget allocated, amount disclosed |
| 20 | Budget Likely | Budget process initiated, approval expected |
| 15 | Budget Possible | Budget exists but not yet allocated to this project |
| 10 | Budget Unknown | Haven't discussed budget yet |
| 5 | Budget Uncertain | Budget not allocated, uncertain approval |
| 0 | No Budget | No budget, no path to budget |

**Red Flags**:
- "We don't have budget" with no plan to get it
- Budget is significantly below your minimum deal size
- Budget owner is unidentified or uninvolved
- Budget allocation is >6 months away

**Green Flags**:
- Budget already approved and allocated
- Budget aligns with your pricing
- Budget owner is engaged in the process
- Budget availability is within this quarter

---

### A - Authority

**Definition**: Is the person you're speaking with able to make or influence the buying decision?

**Key Questions**:
- Who else will be involved in this decision?
- What is your role in the decision-making process?
- Who has final sign-off authority?
- Have you purchased similar solutions before? Who was involved?
- What is the approval process?

**Scoring Criteria**:

| Score | Authority Level | Description |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| 25 | Economic Buyer | Final decision maker, budget owner |
| 20 | Strong Influencer | Significant influence on decision, champions the solution |
| 15 | Key Stakeholder | Part of buying committee, voice matters |
| 10 | User/Evaluator | Will use the product, has input but limited influence |
| 5 | Researcher | Gathering information for others |
| 0 | No Authority | No influence on decision |

**Buyer Personas**:

**Economic Buyer**: Controls budget, final approval
- Usually: VP, Director, C-level
- Can say "yes" when everyone else says "no"

**Technical Buyer**: Evaluates solution fit
- Usually: IT, Engineering, Technical Lead
- Can say "no" but rarely "yes"

**User Buyer**: Will use the solution daily
- Usually: End users, team members
- Influence through adoption and feedback

**Coach/Champion**: Internal advocate for your solution
- Any level, but has influence and wants you to win
- Provides insider information and guides you

**Scoring Authority**:
- If speaking with Economic Buyer: 25 points
- If you have a Champion who has access to Economic Buyer: 20 points
- If in buying committee with Technical Buyer: 15 points
- If only talking to Users: 10 points

**Red Flags**:
- Can't get access to decision maker
- "I need to check with my boss" repeatedly
- Decision maker is completely uninvolved
- Organizational changes (decision maker leaving)

**Green Flags**:
- Direct access to economic buyer

## Lead Scoring System

### Overview

Lead scoring assigns a numerical value (0-100) to each lead based on qualification criteria. This enables prioritization and ensures reps focus on the highest-value opportunities.

### Composite Lead Score

**Total Lead Score** = Qualification Score (BANT or MEDDIC) + Fit Score + Engagement Score

**Score Components**:

1. **Qualification Score** (0-100): BANT or MEDDIC score
2. **Fit Score** (0-20): How well does the lead fit your ICP?
3. **Engagement Score** (0-20): How engaged is the lead?

**Total Possible**: 140 points

## Lead Prioritization

High Score, Low Fit → P2 (Warm) - Assess fit gaps
Low Score, High Fit → P3 (Qualified) - Develop qualification
Low Score, Low Fit → P4/P5 (Nurture/Disqualify) - Long-term or decline
```

### Priority Levels & Actions

**P1 - Hot Leads** (Score 100+, High Fit):
- **SLA**: Respond same day, ideally within 2 hours
- **Action**: Immediate outreach, executive engagement
- **Cadence**: Daily follow-up until meeting scheduled

## Lead Routing Rules

### Routing Criteria

Route leads to the right rep based on:
- **Geography**: Territory assignment
- **Company Size**: SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise
- **Industry**: Vertical specialization
- **Product**: Product-specific reps
- **Lead Score**: Hot leads to senior reps
- **Language**: Language/region requirements

### Routing Logic

```
IF Lead Score >= 100 AND Company Size = Enterprise
  → Route to Enterprise AE (Senior)

ELSE IF Lead Score >= 75 AND Geography = [Territory]
  → Route to Territory AE

ELSE IF Company Size <= 100 employees
  → Route to SMB Rep

ELSE IF Company Size = 100-1000 employees
  → Route to Mid-Market Rep

ELSE IF Company Size >= 1000 employees
  → Route to Enterprise Rep

ELSE IF Industry = [Vertical]
  → Route to Vertical Specialist

ELSE
  → Round-robin to Available Rep
```

### Routing Matrix

| Criteria | Rep Type | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Score 100+, Enterprise | Senior Enterprise AE | John (Enterprise) |
| Score 75-99, US West | Territory AE | Sarah (West Coast) |
| Score 50-74, 100-1000 employees | Mid-Market AE | Mike (MM) |
| Score 50-74, <100 employees | SMB Rep | Lisa (SMB) |
| Industry = Healthcare | Vertical Specialist | Tom (Healthcare) |
| Inbound Demo Request | Demo Team | Demo Team Round-Robin |

## Disqualification Criteria

### When to Disqualify

**Hard Disqualifiers** (Immediate):
- Wrong industry (if you only serve specific verticals)
- Too small (below minimum company size)
- Too large (above your capability to serve)
- Wrong geography (outside serviceable regions)
- Competitor or reseller
- Student/personal use (if B2B only)
- Free trial abuser
- Bad actor (fraud, abuse)

**Soft Disqualifiers** (Deprioritize):
- No budget and no path to budget
- No timeline (>12 months out)
- No authority and can't reach authority
- No clear need or pain
- Poor fit with ICP
- Poor engagement after multiple attempts
- Currently under contract with competitor (>12 months remaining)

---

### Disqualification Process

**Step 1: Validate Disqualification**
- Confirm the disqualifying factor
- Check if there's any path forward
- Consult with manager if borderline

**Step 2: Polite Decline**
- Thank them for their interest
- Explain honestly why it's not a fit (don't ghost)
- Suggest alternatives if possible
- Leave door open for future ("Check back when...")

**Step 3: Document**
- Log disqualification reason in CRM
- Add to exclusion list if necessary
- Update lead status to "Disqualified"

**Step 4: Optional Long-term Nurture**
- Add to very low-touch nurture (quarterly emails)
- Set reminder to re-evaluate in 6-12 months
- Monitor for trigger events (funding, growth, etc.)

---

Thank you again for considering [Solution Name], and best of luck with [their initiative]!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
