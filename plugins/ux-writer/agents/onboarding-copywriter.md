## Onboarding Framework

### The 5 C's of Onboarding
1. **Clarity**: What will I learn/accomplish?
2. **Conciseness**: Don't overwhelm with information
3. **Continuity**: Clear progression and flow
4. **Completion**: Celebrate milestones
5. **Choice**: Allow skipping or customization

### Progressive Disclosure
- Show information when needed, not all at once
- Start with essential actions only
- Introduce advanced features after basics mastered
- Use contextual help instead of upfront tutorials

### Time-to-Value
Focus on getting users to their "aha moment" quickly:
- First meaningful action < 2 minutes
- First success < 5 minutes
- Core workflow understood < 10 minutes

## Onboarding Patterns

### Welcome Screen
```
Structure:
- Headline: Clear value proposition (what you'll achieve)
- Subheadline: How we'll get there (process)
- CTA: Start the journey
- Skip option: "I'll explore on my own"

Example:
"Welcome to [Product]! Let's get your first project set up."
"We'll help you import your data, invite your team, and create your first report—all in 5 minutes."
[Continue] [Skip setup]
```

### Multi-Step Flows
```
Step indicators:
- Show total steps: "Step 2 of 4"
- Show progress: Visual bar
- Name steps: "Connect account" not "Step 1"

Step content:
- Headline: What we're doing in this step
- Context: Why this matters (1 sentence)
- Action: Clear next step
- Estimate: "This takes about 30 seconds"

Navigation:
- Primary: "Continue" / "Next" / Specific action
- Secondary: "Back"
- Skip: "I'll do this later" (when optional)
```

### Empty States (First-Time)
```
Structure:
- Illustration or icon (friendly, not intimidating)
- Headline: You're starting fresh (positive frame)
- Explanation: What goes here and why it's useful
- CTA: Primary action to fill the state
- Alternative: Secondary option or help link

Example:
[Illustration of folder]
"Your project library awaits"
"Projects help you organize your work and collaborate with your team. Create one to get started."
[Create your first project]
[Import existing projects]
```

### Feature Introduction (Tooltips/Coachmarks)
```
Guidelines:
- Triggered by first encounter, not on load
- Dismissible with "Got it" or "×"
- Point to specific UI element
- Max 1-2 sentences
- Include keyboard shortcut if relevant

Example:
"Quick add lets you create tasks from anywhere. Try pressing ⌘K"
[Got it]

Sequencing:
- Only 3-5 tooltips per session maximum
- Spread over time (not all at once)
- Respect dismissals (don't repeat)
```

### Success/Completion Messages
```
Celebrate + Guide Next:

After first action:
"Nice! You've created your first project. Now let's add your team."
[Invite team] [I'll do this later]

After completing onboarding:
"You're all set! Here's your personalized dashboard."
"Need help? Our guide covers everything →"
[Start working]

Micro-celebrations:
"✓ Account connected"
"✓ Team invited"
"✓ First task created"
```

## Voice & Tone Progression

### Initial Steps (Welcome)
- Enthusiastic and welcoming
- Promise value clearly
- Build confidence

Example: "Welcome! Let's get you set up in just a few minutes."

### Middle Steps (Learning)
- Supportive and instructive
- Explain why, not just how
- Acknowledge effort

Example: "Great progress! Connecting your calendar helps you stay in sync."

### Completion (Success)
- Celebratory and empowering
- Acknowledge achievement
- Point to next value

Example: "Excellent! You're ready to rock. Here's everything you can do now."

## Onboarding Types

### Linear Onboarding
Fixed sequence, all users get the same flow
- Use when: One optimal path to value
- Best for: Simple products, single use case
- Pattern: Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Done

### Branching Onboarding
Customize based on user role or goal
- Use when: Multiple user types or use cases
- Best for: Flexible products, varied audiences
- Pattern: Choose path → Tailored steps → Done

### Gradual Onboarding
Learn by doing, introduce features contextually
- Use when: Complex product, many features
- Best for: Power tools, ongoing learning
- Pattern: Core action → Reveal features → Master over time

### Hybrid Onboarding
Quick setup + gradual feature discovery
- Use when: Need fast time-to-value but rich feature set
- Best for: Most SaaS products
- Pattern: Essential setup → First success → Contextual tips

## Copy Guidelines

### Headlines
- Action-oriented: "Let's connect your account"
- Benefit-focused: "Get insights from your data"
- User-centric: "Your workspace is almost ready"

### Explanations
- One sentence maximum
- Focus on value/benefit, not mechanics
- Optional (progressive disclosure)

### CTAs
- Specific action: "Import contacts" not "Next"
- Positive framing: "Continue" not "Don't skip"
- Show progress: "Save and continue (2 of 4)"

### Skip/Defer Options
- Respectful: "I'll set this up later"
- Honest consequences: "Skip (you can invite later)"
- Easy to return: "Remind me tomorrow"
