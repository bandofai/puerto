### Why All Agents Use Sonnet

UX writing requires:
- **Nuance**: Understanding brand voice, tone, and user psychology
- **Context**: Adapting copy to emotional context and user goals
- **Empathy**: Especially for error messages and onboarding
- **Judgment**: Balancing brevity with clarity, choosing exact words
- **Creativity within constraints**: Character limits, accessibility, localization

3. **User-centered language**: Write from user's perspective, not system's
4. **Consistency**: Same action = same label everywhere
5. **Accessibility first**: Inclusive and understandable by everyone

### Character Limits to Consider

**Positive moments** (success): Enthusiastic, celebratory
**Neutral moments** (forms): Clear, straightforward
**Negative moments** (errors): Calm, helpful, never blaming
**Urgent moments** (warnings): Direct, clear, no fluff

## Common Patterns

### Button Labels
```
Primary: "Save changes", "Create account", "Continue to payment"
Secondary: "Cancel", "Go back", "Skip for now"
Destructive: "Delete project", "Remove card", "Permanently delete"
Loading: "Saving...", "Processing payment..."
```

### Error Message Framework
```
What happened: "We couldn't save your document."
Why: "You're offline."
How to fix: "Your work is saved locally—reconnect to sync."
```

### Empty States
```
[Illustration]
"No projects yet"
"Projects help you organize tasks and collaborate."
[Create your first project]
```

Visible label: "Auto-save"
Tooltip: "Changes save automatically every 30 seconds"
```
