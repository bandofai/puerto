```

### Alert Flow
```
1. storage-monitor: Detect threshold violation
2. storage-monitor: Generate alert with recommendations
3. backup-scheduler: Review retention policy
4. backup-scheduler: Suggest cleanup actions
5. User: Approve or modify plan
6. backup-scheduler: Execute cleanup (if approved)
```

### Recovery Flow
```
1. User: Request disaster recovery
2. backup-verifier: Identify latest verified backup
3. backup-verifier: Run integrity checks
4. backup-verifier: Execute recovery to test environment
5. backup-verifier: Validate recovered data
6. backup-scheduler: Generate recovery report
7. User: Approve for production restore
```

## Configuration

### Default Paths
- Config: `~/.backup-manager/config.json`
- Backups: `~/.backup-manager/backups/`
- Logs: `~/.backup-manager/backup.log`
- Alerts: `~/.backup-manager/alerts.log`
- Metrics: `~/.backup-manager/storage-metrics.log`

### Configuration Structure
```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "path": "/path/to/data",
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "schedule": "daily|weekly|monthly",
      "rpo": "1h|24h|7d",
      "rto": "2h|4h|24h"
    }
  ],
  "destinations": {
    "google_drive": {
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "backups/",
      "credentials": "~/.backup-manager/gdrive-token.json"
    },
    "dropbox": {...},
    "local": {...}
  },
  "retention": {
    "daily": 7,
    "weekly": 4,
    "monthly": 6,
    "yearly": 3
  },
  "alerts": {
    "low_space_threshold": 0.1,
    "failed_backup_notify": true,
    "verification_failure_notify": true
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

### Python Packages
- google-api-python-client: Google Drive API
- google-auth-httplib2: Google authentication
- google-auth-oauthlib: OAuth2 flow
- dropbox: Dropbox API
- requests: HTTP requests (OneDrive)

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Bash 4.0+
- rsync
- Standard Unix tools (tar, gzip, sha256sum)
- cron (for scheduling)

## Performance Characteristics

### Backup Speed
- Local: ~100 MB/s (SSD)
- Cloud: Network-dependent (throttled)
- Compression: 2-3x size reduction (gzip)

### Verification Speed
- Checksums: ~200 MB/s
- Recovery test: ~100 MB/s
- Full validation: 5-10 min per 10 GB

### Resource Usage
- CPU: Low (5-10% during backup)
- Memory: < 200 MB typical
- Network: Throttled (configurable)
- Disk I/O: Background priority

## Security

### Data Protection
- At-rest encryption option (AES-256)
- In-transit TLS (all cloud providers)
- Secure credential storage (system keychain integration)

### Access Control
- Minimal permissions (principle of least privilege)
- Read-only monitoring access
- Service accounts for cloud APIs
- No destructive operations without confirmation

### Audit Trail
- All operations logged with timestamps
- User identification
- Success/failure tracking
- Verification history

## Best Practices

### Scheduling Recommendations
- Full backups: Weekly (Sunday 1-2 AM)
- Incremental: Daily (2-4 AM)
- Verification: Daily (3 AM, post-backup)
- Recovery testing: Monthly (last Sunday)
- Retention enforcement: Weekly (after backups)

### Verification Schedule
- Automated integrity: After every backup
- Full recovery test: Monthly minimum
- Quarterly: Comprehensive audit
- Before major changes: Manual verification

### Monitoring
- Capacity checks: Every 6 hours
- Metrics collection: Hourly
- Trend analysis: Weekly
- Health reports: Monthly

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-Deployment
1. Validate configuration syntax
2. Test backup execution (dry run)
3. Verify cloud credentials
4. Test restoration procedure
5. Validate alert mechanisms

### Regular Testing
1. Monthly recovery drills
2. Quarterly disaster recovery exercises
3. Annual comprehensive audit
4. After configuration changes

### Metrics to Track
- Backup success rate
- Average backup duration
- Verification pass rate
- Recovery test results
- Storage growth rate
- Alert frequency

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Incremental cloud sync (delta uploads)
- Backup encryption by default
- Email/Slack alert integration
- Web dashboard for monitoring
- Automated capacity expansion recommendations
- Machine learning for anomaly detection
- Blockchain-based integrity verification
- Cross-region redundancy
- Backup deduplication

### Integration Opportunities

- Database-specific strategies (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Container volume backups
- Virtual machine snapshots
- API data backups

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backup fails to start**

- Verify script permissions
- Review logs for errors
- Test manual execution

**Cloud upload fails**
- Verify credentials valid
- Check network connectivity
- Confirm quota available
- Review provider status
