```

### Campaign Types
- **Search**: Text ads on Google search results

## Bidding Strategies

### Manual Bidding

- Enhanced CPC: Manual + automated adjustments (up to 30%)

### Automated Bidding
- **Target CPA**: Optimize for cost per acquisition
- **Target ROAS**: Optimize for return on ad spend
- **Maximize Conversions**: Get most conversions within budget
- **Maximize Conversion Value**: Maximize total conversion value

## Quality Score (1-10)

Components:
1. **Expected CTR** (most important): Historical + predicted click-through rate
2. **Ad Relevance**: How well ad matches search intent
3. **Landing Page Experience**: Page load speed, mobile-friendly, relevance

Improving Quality Score:
- Add keywords to ad headlines
- Improve landing page speed (<3s load time)
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Match ad copy to landing page content
- Use ad extensions

## Match Types

- **Exact**: [keyword] - Only exact matches
- **Phrase**: "keyword" - Phrase in any order
- **Broad**: keyword - Related searches
- **Broad Match Modifier**: +keyword - Must include term

Layering strategy: Exact (high bid) → Phrase (medium) → Broad (low)

## Ad Extensions

Essential extensions:
- Sitelinks (additional links)
- Callouts (features/benefits)
- Structured snippets (product categories)
- Call extensions (phone number)
- Location extensions (address)
- Price extensions (pricing)

## Budget Management

- Daily budget = Monthly budget ÷ 30.4
- Allow 2x daily spending (Google averages over month)
- Monitor spend pacing (should reach ~50% by mid-month)
- Adjust bids, not budgets, for optimization

## Performance Metrics

- **CTR**: Click-Through Rate (good: >3% for search)
- **CPC**: Cost Per Click
- **CPA**: Cost Per Acquisition
- **ROAS**: Return on Ad Spend (revenue ÷ cost)
- **Conversion Rate**: Conversions ÷ clicks
- **Impression Share**: % of available impressions won
