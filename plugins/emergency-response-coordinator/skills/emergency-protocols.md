## Incident Command System (ICS)

### ICS Overview

The Incident Command System is a standardized, on-scene, all-hazard incident management system used by emergency responders.

**Core Principles**:
1. **Common Terminology**: Standard terms for positions, facilities, resources
2. **Modular Organization**: Expand/contract based on incident complexity
3. **Management by Objectives**: Clear incident objectives drive all actions
4. **Incident Action Plan**: Documented plan for each operational period
5. **Chain of Command**: Clear reporting relationships
6. **Unity of Command**: Each person reports to one supervisor
7. **Unified Command**: Agencies work together seamlessly
8. **Span of Control**: Supervisors manage 3-7 direct reports (optimal: 5)
9. **Accountability**: Track all resources and personnel
10. **Dispatch/Deployment**: Request and release resources efficiently

## Emergency Response Procedures

### Medical Emergency Response

**Immediate Actions (First 60 Seconds)**:
```markdown
1. Scene safety assessment
   - Is scene safe to approach?
   - Are there ongoing hazards?
   - Do I need PPE?

2. Call for help
   - Dial 911 / Emergency number
   - Activate internal emergency alert
   - Request AED if cardiac-related

3. Initial assessment (ABCs)
   - Airway: Is airway open?
   - Breathing: Is person breathing?
   - Circulation: Do they have pulse?
   - Disability: Level of consciousness?
   - Exposure: Visible injuries?
```

**CPR Protocol** (Adult):
```markdown
IF no pulse AND not breathing:
1. Position patient flat on firm surface
2. Call 911 (if not already done)
3. Begin chest compressions:
   - Place heel of hand on center of chest
   - Place other hand on top, interlock fingers
   - Position shoulders directly over hands
   - Compress 2 inches deep
   - Rate: 100-120 compressions/minute
   - Allow complete chest recoil

4. Provide rescue breaths (if trained):
   - After 30 compressions, give 2 breaths
   - Tilt head back, lift chin
   - Pinch nose, seal mouth
   - Each breath 1 second, watch chest rise
   - Ratio: 30 compressions : 2 breaths

5. Continue until:
   - AED arrives and is ready to use
   - EMS takes over
   - Patient shows signs of life
   - You are too exhausted to continue
   - Scene becomes unsafe
```

**AED Protocol**:
```markdown
1. Turn on AED (follows voice prompts)
2. Expose chest, ensure dry
3. Apply pads as shown on diagram
4. Ensure no one is touching patient
5. Allow AED to analyze rhythm
6. If shock advised:
   - Ensure everyone clear ("Clear!")
   - Press shock button
   - Resume CPR immediately
7. If no shock advised:
   - Resume CPR immediately
8. Follow AED prompts, reanalyze every 2 minutes
```

**Choking Response** (Conscious Adult):
```markdown
1. Ask: "Are you choking?"
2. If yes and cannot speak/cough:

   Heimlich Maneuver:
   - Stand behind person
   - Wrap arms around waist
   - Make fist with one hand, thumb side against abdomen
   - Grasp fist with other hand
   - Quick upward thrusts into abdomen
   - Repeat until object dislodges or person unconscious

3. If person becomes unconscious:
   - Lower to ground
   - Call 911 (if not done)
   - Begin CPR
   - Before each set of breaths, check mouth for object
```

**Severe Bleeding Control**:
```markdown
1. Personal safety: Gloves if available
2. Direct pressure:
   - Apply gauze/cloth directly on wound
   - Press firmly with both hands if needed
   - Maintain pressure without releasing

3. If bleeding continues:
   - Add more dressing (don't remove original)
   - Increase pressure
   - Elevate extremity above heart if possible

4. If bleeding still not controlled:
   - Apply tourniquet if extremity and available
   - Place 2-3 inches above wound (not on joint)
   - Tighten until bleeding stops
   - Note time of application
   - Do NOT remove tourniquet

5. Treat for shock:
   - Lay person down
   - Elevate legs 12 inches (if no head/spine injury)
   - Keep warm
   - Monitor consciousness
```

**Stroke Recognition (FAST)**:
```markdown
F - Face: Ask person to smile. Does one side droop?
A - Arms: Ask to raise both arms. Does one drift down?
S - Speech: Ask to repeat simple phrase. Is speech slurred?
T - Time: If any sign present, call 911 immediately

ADDITIONAL SIGNS:
- Sudden confusion
- Trouble seeing in one or both eyes
- Trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance
- Severe headache with no known cause

TIME IS CRITICAL: Note time symptoms started
```
