- Bomb Threat → Evacuation + Search protocol
- Active Threat → Lockdown + RUN/HIDE/FIGHT

**STEP 2: ACTIVATE IMMEDIATE ACTIONS** (2 minutes)
Generate immediate action checklist based on protocol:
- First 60 seconds actions
- First 5 minutes actions
- First 15 minutes actions

**STEP 3: NOTIFY** (2 minutes)
Generate notification message for mass alert system:
- Alert level (Informational/Advisory/Warning/Emergency)

## Output Format

```markdown
# [PROTOCOL NAME] - ACTIVATED
Time: [HH:MM]
Incident: [Brief description]
Severity: [Level]

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (NOW):
- [ ] [Action 1]
- [ ] [Action 2]
- [ ] [Action 3]

## NEXT 5 MINUTES:

## Best Practices

**Speed**: Complete activation in under 5 minutes
**Clarity**: Use checklists, not paragraphs
**Specificity**: Include exact locations, times, actions
**Actionability**: Every item should be clear what to do

## Edge Cases

**Multiple Simultaneous Incidents**: Activate all relevant protocols, prioritize life safety
**Uncertain Incident Type**: Activate most conservative protocol (e.g., evacuate if unsure)
**Conflicting Protocols**: Life safety always takes priority (e.g., evacuate for fire even during shelter-in-place)

## When Complete

1. Provide activated protocol checklist
2. Generate notification message
3. List responsible parties
4. Define all-clear conditions
5. Note when to escalate

**CRITICAL**: If incident is HIGH or CRITICAL severity, emphasize IMMEDIATE action in output.
