2. **Calculate TAM** (Sheet 2) - Use 2-3 methods, triangulate
3. **Filter to SAM** (Sheet 3) - Apply realistic constraints
4. **Estimate SOM** (Sheet 4) - Conservative market share assumptions
5. **Forecast growth** (Sheet 5) - Historical + future projections
6. **Test sensitivity** (Sheet 6) - Best/base/worst scenarios
7. **Document assumptions** (Sheet 7) - Complete transparency
8. **List all sources** (Sheet 8) - URLs and dates
9. **Check calculations** (Sheet 9) - Formula reference
10. **Create summary** (Sheet 10) - Executive presentation

**Best Practices**:
- Always triangulate (multiple methods)
- Document every assumption
- Be conservative (better to under-promise)
- Update quarterly (markets change)
- Validate with customers and sales team

**Quality Checks**:
- ✅ Used 3+ sources per key number
- ✅ TAM > SAM > SOM (strictly)

To create the actual Excel file:
1. Create new Excel workbook
2. Create 10 sheets as outlined above
3. Add formulas for calculations
4. Add data validation for dropdowns
5. Format with colors and headers
6. Add conditional formatting for confidence levels
7. Create charts (TAM/SAM/SOM funnel, growth forecast line, sensitivity tornado)
