# Customer Segmentation Skill

**Production-tested frameworks for market segmentation, persona development, and customer needs analysis**

This skill codifies best practices from product marketing, customer research, and behavioral economics validated across B2B and B2C markets.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Actionable Segmentation**: Segments must enable different strategies - if you'd market/sell the same way, don't segment
2. **Evidence-Based Personas**: Base on real customer data, not assumptions - include actual quotes and behaviors
3. **Needs-Focused**: Understand what customers need to accomplish (jobs-to-be-done), not just who they are
4. **Quantified Segments**: Size each segment with data - must know revenue potential
5. **Prioritized Approach**: Can't target all segments equally - explicitly prioritize with criteria

---

## Segmentation Frameworks

### Framework 1: Demographic/Firmographic Segmentation

**Use when**: Basic market structure, readily available data, established markets

**B2C Demographics**:
- Age / Generation (Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X, Boomer)
- Gender
- Income level
- Education
- Family status (single, married, children)
- Location (urban, suburban, rural)
- Occupation / Career stage

**B2B Firmographics**:
- Industry / Vertical (NAICS codes)
- Company size (employees, revenue)
- Geographic location (HQ, operations)
- Ownership structure (public, private, PE-backed)
- Growth stage (startup, growth, mature)
- Technology stack / Digital maturity

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Easy to identify and measure
- ✅ Data readily available (Census, databases)
- ✅ Can target with advertising platforms
- ✅ Good for initial market sizing

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Demographics ≠ needs or behaviors
- ❌ Two people with same demographics can have very different needs
- ❌ Doesn't explain "why" they buy
- ❌ Limited differentiation value

**Best Practice**: Use demographics as ONE layer, combine with behavioral or needs-based

**Example**:
```markdown
**Segment**: Mid-Market Tech Companies
- Industry: Software, Tech Services
- Employees: 50-500
- Revenue: $10M-$100M
- Location: US & Canada
- Tech Maturity: Cloud-native, modern stack

**Size**: 12,000 companies
**TAM**: $180M (12,000 × $15k ACV)
```

### Framework 2: Behavioral Segmentation

**Use when**: Understanding usage patterns, purchase behavior, engagement levels

**Behavioral Variables**:

1. **Usage Level**:
   - Heavy users (power users, super users)
   - Medium users (regular users)
   - Light users (occasional users)
   - Non-users (potential customers)

2. **Purchase Behavior**:
   - Purchase frequency (annual, quarterly, one-time)
   - Average order value (small, medium, large deals)
   - Purchase timing (seasonal, event-driven, continuous)
   - Decision speed (fast movers, slow evaluators)

3. **Engagement Level**:
   - Highly engaged (daily active, advocates)
   - Moderately engaged (weekly active)
   - Low engagement (monthly, dormant)
   - Churned (former customers)

4. **Benefits Sought**:
   - Performance seekers (want best/fastest)
   - Value seekers (want best ROI)
   - Convenience seekers (want ease/simplicity)
   - Status seekers (want prestige/brand)

5. **Loyalty Status**:
   - Brand loyalists (won't switch)
   - Satisfied users (happy but could switch)
   - Switchers (actively shop around)
   - Churned (left for competitor)

6. **Adoption Stage**:
   - Innovators (2.5% - bleeding edge)
   - Early Adopters (13.5% - thought leaders)
   - Early Majority (34% - pragmatists)
   - Late Majority (34% - conservatives)
   - Laggards (16% - skeptics)

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Directly tied to revenue and growth
- ✅ Can predict future behavior from past
- ✅ Enables targeted retention/upsell strategies
- ✅ Measurable through analytics

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Requires behavioral data (not always available)
- ❌ Behaviors can change over time
- ❌ Doesn't explain "why" behind behaviors
- ❌ Can be complex to track across channels

**Example**:
```markdown
**Segment**: Power Users
- Usage: Daily active, 3+ hours/day
- Features Used: 80%+ of available features
- Purchase: Annual subscription, highest tier
- Engagement: Participates in community, provides feedback
- Loyalty: NPS 9-10, 95% retention

**Size**: 5,000 users (8% of base)
**Revenue Contribution**: $12M (40% of total)
**LTV**: $2,400 vs avg $600
```

### Framework 3: Psychographic Segmentation

**Use when**: Understanding values, attitudes, lifestyle, personality

**Psychographic Variables**:

1. **Values** (what they care about):
   - Innovation vs Tradition
   - Performance vs Simplicity
   - Status vs Practicality
   - Individual vs Community
   - Sustainability vs Convenience

2. **Attitudes**:
   - Risk tolerance (risk-taker vs risk-averse)
   - Technology adoption (early adopter vs laggard)
   - Brand consciousness (brand-loyal vs price-focused)
   - Quality orientation (perfectionist vs "good enough")

3. **Lifestyle**:
   - Work style (remote, hybrid, office-based)
   - Hobbies and interests
   - Media consumption patterns
   - Social activities
   - Health/wellness focus

4. **Personality**:
   - Introverted vs Extroverted
   - Analytical vs Intuitive
   - Detail-oriented vs Big-picture
   - Collaborative vs Independent

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Explains "why" customers buy
- ✅ Enables emotional connection and messaging
- ✅ Differentiates similar demographic groups
- ✅ Helps with brand positioning

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Hard to measure and identify
- ❌ Requires surveys or research
- ❌ Difficult to target with advertising
- ❌ Can be subjective

**Example**:
```markdown
**Segment**: Innovation Champions
- Values: Cutting-edge technology, thought leadership, competitive advantage
- Attitude: Risk-tolerant, early adopter, loves learning new tools
- Lifestyle: Attends conferences, active in online communities, reads tech blogs
- Personality: Analytical, data-driven, influential in organization

**Characteristics**:
- Willing to pay premium for innovation
- Tolerates bugs/imperfection for early access
- Provides detailed feedback
- Champions products internally
- Influences peers (high viral coefficient)

**Size**: ~10% of market
**Strategic Value**: HIGH (early revenue, product feedback, references, word-of-mouth)
```

### Framework 4: Needs-Based Segmentation (Jobs-to-be-Done)

**Use when**: Understanding why customers "hire" your product, what job they need done

**Jobs-to-be-Done Framework**:

Customers don't buy products, they "hire" them to do a job.

**Job Categories**:

1. **Functional Jobs** (practical tasks):
   - "I need to [accomplish task]"
   - "I need to [solve problem]"
   - Examples: "Manage my schedule", "Track expenses", "Communicate with team"

2. **Emotional Jobs** (how they want to feel):
   - "I want to feel [emotion]"
   - Examples: "Feel confident", "Reduce anxiety", "Feel accomplished"

3. **Social Jobs** (how they want to be perceived):
   - "I want to be seen as [identity]"
   - Examples: "Be seen as innovative", "Be viewed as responsible"

**Job Components**:

```markdown
**Job Statement**: When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]

Example:
- When I'm managing my team remotely
- I want to keep everyone aligned and productive
- So I can deliver projects on time and keep morale high
```

**Needs-Based Segments**: Group by primary job to be done

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Explains purchase motivation clearly
- ✅ Identifies unmet needs and innovation opportunities
- ✅ Transcends demographics (people with same job can be very different)
- ✅ Enables job-focused messaging and positioning

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Requires deep customer research (interviews, observation)
- ❌ Can be abstract and hard to measure
- ❌ Segments can overlap (customers have multiple jobs)
- ❌ Doesn't help with targeting/media buying

**Example**:
```markdown
**Segment**: Compliance Managers (Job-focused)

**Primary Job**: Ensure company meets regulatory requirements without slowing business

**Functional Needs**:
- Track changing regulations
- Document compliance processes
- Generate audit reports
- Manage remediation

**Emotional Needs**:
- Reduce anxiety about non-compliance
- Feel confident in audits
- Avoid being the "blocker"

**Social Needs**:
- Be seen as protecting company
- Be viewed as enabling (not just policing)

**Current Alternatives** (how they do job today):
- Spreadsheets (50%)
- Generic project management tools (30%)
- Manual processes (15%)
- Dedicated compliance software (5%)

**Job Performance Gaps** (pain points):
- Regulations change faster than they can track
- Scattered documentation across systems
- Manual audit prep is time-consuming
- Hard to prove compliance to auditors

**Desired Outcomes**:
- Stay ahead of regulatory changes
- Reduce audit prep time by 80%
- Confidence in compliance status at any time
- Respect from business teams

**Size**: 50,000 compliance managers in target industries
**Willingness to Pay**: HIGH (risk mitigation, audit costs)
```

### Framework 5: Hybrid Segmentation (Recommended)

**Best practice**: Combine multiple variables for robust segmentation

**Typical Hybrid Approach**:

```markdown
**Segment Definition**: [Segment Name]

**Firmographic/Demographic** (Who they are):
- [Key attributes that help identify and reach them]

**Behavioral** (What they do):
- [Observable behaviors, usage patterns, purchase history]

**Psychographic** (How they think):
- [Values, attitudes that drive decisions]

**Needs-Based** (Why they buy):
- [Primary job to be done, key pain points, desired outcomes]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
**Segment**: Fast-Growing Tech Startups

**Firmographic**:
- Industry: SaaS, Technology
- Size: 10-50 employees
- Stage: Series A/B
- Growth: 100%+ YoY
- Location: Major tech hubs

**Behavioral**:
- Early adopters of new tools
- Rapid deployment (<30 days)
- High engagement, daily usage
- Frequent upgrades/additions
- Community participants

**Psychographic**:
- Value: Move fast, ship quality
- Attitude: Risk-tolerant, innovation-focused
- Personality: Data-driven, experimental

**Needs-Based**:
- **Job**: Scale operations without slowing velocity
- **Functional**: Automate processes, integrate tools, maintain quality
- **Emotional**: Reduce chaos, maintain startup culture
- **Social**: Be seen as innovative, attract talent

**Size**: 8,000 companies
**ACV**: $25k (higher than avg $15k)
**Growth Rate**: 40% YoY (vs market 15%)
**Strategic Value**: HIGH (land and expand, great references, early product feedback)
**Priority**: Tier 1 (Primary target)
```

## Persona Development Framework

**Purpose**: Bring segments to life with specific, relatable profiles

### Persona vs Segment

**Segment**:

**Persona**:
- Qualitative representation
- Specific character who represents segment
- Example: "Sarah Chen, Director of IT at 5,000-person healthcare company"

**Relationship**: Each segment has 1-2 representative personas

### Persona Research Methods

**Quantitative Methods**:
1. **Surveys** (n=100+ per segment):
   - Demographics/firmographics
   - Behavior patterns
   - Preferences and priorities
   - Satisfaction levels

2. **Analytics Data**:
   - Usage patterns
   - Feature adoption
   - Engagement metrics
   - Conversion funnels

3. **CRM/Sales Data**:
   - Company attributes
   - Deal size and velocity
   - Win/loss reasons

**Qualitative Methods**:
1. **Customer Interviews** (n=10-15 per segment):
   - Goals and challenges
   - Decision process
   - Pain points and frustrations
   - Workflows and context
   - **Format**: 30-45 min, semi-structured
   - **Key**: Ask "why" 5 times, observe environment

2. **Win/Loss Interviews**:
   - Why did we win/lose?
   - What alternatives were considered?
   - What were the decision criteria?
   - Who was involved in decision?

3. **Customer Observation**:

   - Note pain points and workarounds
   - Identify unspoken needs

4. **Sales Team Interviews**:
   - Common objections
   - Buying patterns

   - Competitive dynamics

**Synthesis**:
- Combine quant (what) + qual (why)
- Look for patterns across research
- Create composite persona (not one real person)
- Validate with stakeholders

## Segmentation Validation Criteria

**Good segmentation must meet ALL criteria**:

### 1. Measurable
- ✅ Can you size the segment with data?
- ✅ Can you track segment performance?
- ❌ If segment is "people who would love our product" (not measurable)

### 2. Substantial
- ✅ Is segment large enough to be profitable?
- ✅ Minimum viable segment: Usually >$1M revenue potential
- ❌ If segment is 100 companies × $1k ACV = $100k (too small)

### 3. Accessible
- ✅ Can you reach this segment with marketing/sales?
- ✅ Can you identify segment members?
- ❌ If segment is "people who think about X" but no way to find them

### 4. Differentiable
- ✅ Do segments respond differently to marketing?
- ✅ Do they have different needs/preferences?
- ❌ If all segments want the same thing (don't segment)

### 5. Actionable
- ✅ Can you create different strategies per segment?
- ✅ Can you serve them differently?
- ❌ If you'd market/sell the same way (don't segment)

**Test**: If you can't answer "How would we serve Segment A differently from Segment B?", they shouldn't be separate segments.

---

## Segment Prioritization Framework

**Can't target all segments equally - must prioritize**

### Prioritization Matrix

**Score each segment on 4 dimensions (1-10 scale)**:

1. **Attractiveness** (Market characteristics):
   - Market size: [Larger = higher score]
   - Growth rate: [Faster = higher]
   - Profitability: [Higher margin = higher]
   - Competitive intensity: [Less = higher]

2. **Fit** (Our capabilities):
   - Product/service match: [Better = higher]
   - Brand perception: [Positive = higher]
   - Existing capabilities: [Stronger = higher]
   - Experience in segment: [More = higher]

3. **Accessibility** (Ease of reaching):
   - Marketing efficiency: [Lower CAC = higher]
   - Sales channel access: [Better = higher]
   - Geographic proximity: [Closer = higher]
   - Decision-maker access: [Easier = higher]

4. **Strategic Value** (Long-term importance):
   - Strategic positioning: [More important = higher]
   - Reference value: [Higher = higher]
   - Expansion potential: [More = higher]
   - Learning value: [More = higher]

**Calculation**:
```
Total Score = Attractiveness + Fit + Accessibility + Strategic Value
(Max: 40, Min: 4)

Tier 1 (Primary): 30-40
Tier 2 (Secondary): 20-29
Tier 3 (Opportunistic): <20
```

**Resource Allocation**:
- Tier 1: 60-70% of resources
- Tier 2: 25-35% of resources
- Tier 3: 5-10% of resources

### Prioritization Template

```markdown
# Segment Prioritization: [Company/Product Name]

| Segment | Attractiveness | Fit | Accessibility | Strategic Value | Total | Tier |
|---------|---------------|-----|---------------|----------------|-------|------|
| [Segment 1] | 9 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 34 | 1 |
| [Segment 2] | 8 | 9 | 7 | 8 | 32 | 1 |
| [Segment 3] | 7 | 6 | 8 | 5 | 26 | 2 |
| [Segment 4] | 6 | 5 | 6 | 4 | 21 | 2 |
| [Segment 5] | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 17 | 3 |

## Tier 1 (Primary Focus)
**Segments**: [Segment 1, Segment 2]
**Resource Allocation**: 65%
**Expected Revenue**: $[Amount] (Year 1)
**Strategy**: [Dedicated sales team, custom marketing, full product support]

## Tier 2 (Secondary Focus)
**Segments**: [Segment 3, Segment 4]
**Resource Allocation**: 30%
**Expected Revenue**: $[Amount] (Year 1)
**Strategy**: [Shared resources, programmatic marketing, standard product]

## Tier 3 (Opportunistic)
**Segments**: [Segment 5]
**Resource Allocation**: 5%
**Expected Revenue**: $[Amount] (Year 1)
**Strategy**: [Inbound only, self-service, minimal support]
```

## Common Segmentation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Many Segments

**Wrong**:
```
15 different segments, each with custom strategy
```

**Right**:
```
3-5 meaningful segments, prioritized
Can always sub-segment later
```

**Why**: Resource dilution, complexity, lack of focus

### Mistake 2: Demographic-Only Segmentation

**Wrong**:
```
Segment 1: Age 25-35
Segment 2: Age 35-45
(Same needs, different ages)
```

**Right**:
```
Segment 1: Career-focused professionals (need career advancement tools)
Segment 2: Work-life balance seekers (need efficiency tools)
(Different needs, might include various ages)
```

**Why**: Demographics don't equal needs

### Mistake 3: Segments Too Similar

**Wrong**:
```
Segment A: Mid-market companies
Segment B: Upper mid-market companies
(Would market/sell the same way)
```

**Right**:
```
Segment A: Mid-market with IT dept (complex sale, IT buyer)
Segment B: Mid-market without IT (simple sale, business buyer)
(Different buying process, needs, messaging)
```

**Why**: If you can't serve differently, don't segment

### Mistake 4: Made-Up Personas

**Wrong**:
```
"Marketing Mary loves our product because..."
(Based on assumptions, not research)
```

**Right**:
```
"Based on 15 interviews, CMOs at growth-stage companies prioritize X, Y, Z"
(Evidence-based, with quotes and data)
```

**Why**: Personas should reflect reality, not wishes

### Mistake 5: No Prioritization

**Wrong**:
```
"We serve all 8 segments equally"
(Resources spread thin, no focus)
```

**Right**:
```
"Tier 1: Segments A & B (70% of resources)
Tier 2: Segments C & D (25% of resources)
Tier 3: Others (5% opportunistic)"
```

**Why**: Can't be everything to everyone

## Segmentation Workflow

### Phase 1: Hypothesis (Week 1)

1. **Brainstorm potential segments**:
   - Review existing customer base
   - Analyze won/lost deals
   - Interview sales/CS teams
   - Study market data

2. **Draft segment hypotheses**:
   - 5-7 potential segments
   - Based on demographics, behaviors, needs
   - Preliminary sizing

3. **Prioritize research**:
   - Which segments to validate first
   - What questions to answer

### Phase 2: Research (Weeks 2-4)

1. **Quantitative research**:
   - Survey existing customers (n=100+)
   - Analyze usage data
   - Review CRM/sales data
   - Study market reports

2. **Qualitative research**:
   - Customer interviews (10-15 per segment)
   - Win/loss analysis
   - Sales team interviews
   - Observation/shadowing

3. **Synthesis**:
   - Pattern identification
   - Segment validation
   - Refine segment definitions

### Phase 3: Segmentation (Week 5)

1. **Finalize segments** (typically 3-5):
   - Define each segment clearly
   - Size each segment
   - Validate against criteria (measurable, substantial, etc.)

2. **Create personas** (1-2 per segment):
   - Synthesize research into personas
   - Include quotes and evidence
   - Validate with stakeholders

3. **Prioritize segments**:
   - Score on attractiveness, fit, accessibility, strategic value
   - Assign to tiers (1/2/3)
   - Define resource allocation

### Phase 4: Strategy (Week 6)

1. **Segment-specific strategies**:
   - Value proposition per segment
   - Messaging framework
   - Channel strategy
   - Content plan
   - Sales approach

2. **Implementation plan**:
   - Marketing campaigns
   - Sales enablement
   - Product roadmap
   - Metrics and KPIs

### Phase 5: Execution & Iteration (Ongoing)

1. **Launch**:
   - Execute segment strategies
   - Track performance by segment
   - Gather feedback

2. **Measure**:
   - Segment performance metrics
   - Conversion rates by segment
   - LTV, CAC by segment
   - Feedback and satisfaction

3. **Iterate**:
   - Refine personas (quarterly)
   - Adjust prioritization (quarterly)
   - Update strategies (quarterly)
   - Re-segment as market evolves (annually)

## Segmentation Checklist

**Before finalizing segmentation**:

### Research Quality
- [ ] Conducted quant research (survey, analytics, CRM)
- [ ] Conducted qual research (interviews, observation)
- [ ] Sample size sufficient (100+ quant, 10+ qual per segment)
- [ ] Included customers and prospects
- [ ] Validated with sales/CS teams

### Segment Quality
- [ ] 3-7 segments (not too few, not too many)
- [ ] Each segment is measurable (can size and track)
- [ ] Each segment is substantial (>$1M potential)
- [ ] Each segment is accessible (can reach and identify)
- [ ] Segments are differentiable (respond differently)
- [ ] Segments are actionable (can serve differently)

### Persona Quality
- [ ] Based on research, not assumptions
- [ ] Includes real quotes from customers
- [ ] Covers goals, pain points, decision process
- [ ] Documents needs (functional, emotional, social)
- [ ] Includes objections and how to overcome
- [ ] Validated with customer-facing teams

### Prioritization
- [ ] Scored all segments on 4 dimensions
- [ ] Assigned to tiers (1/2/3)
- [ ] Defined resource allocation
- [ ] Justified prioritization decisions

### Strategy
- [ ] Value prop defined per segment
- [ ] Messaging framework per segment
- [ ] Channel strategy per segment
- [ ] Content plan per segment
- [ ] Sales approach per segment
- [ ] Metrics defined per segment

## Summary

**Core Takeaways**:

1. **Multi-variable segmentation** - Demographics + Behavior + Needs
2. **Evidence-based personas** - Research, not assumptions
3. **Must prioritize** - Can't serve all segments equally
4. **Actionable segmentation** - Different strategies per segment
5. **Continuous refinement** - Update quarterly, re-segment annually

**Red Flags** (Don't do this):

- ❌ 10+ segments (too complex)
- ❌ Demographic-only (doesn't explain needs)
- ❌ Made-up personas (no research)
- ❌ No prioritization (spread too thin)
- ❌ Can't serve differently (why segment?)

**Green Lights** (Do this):

- ✅ 3-5 meaningful segments
- ✅ Hybrid segmentation (who + what + why)
- ✅ Research-based personas (quotes, data)
- ✅ Clear prioritization (Tier 1/2/3)
- ✅ Differentiated strategies per segment
