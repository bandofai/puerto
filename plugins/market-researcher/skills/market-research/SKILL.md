## Core Principles

1. **Data Triangulation**: Never rely on a single source - validate with 3+ independent sources
2. **Transparent Methodology**: Show your work - all assumptions and calculations must be explicit
3. **Conservative Estimates**: When in doubt, be conservative - overpromising is worse than underpromising
4. **Source Quality Matters**: Weight Tier 1 sources (government, public filings) higher than Tier 3 (blogs)
5. **Document Everything**: Link to all sources with access dates - research must be reproducible

## TAM/SAM/SOM Framework

### Definitions

**TAM (Total Addressable Market)**:
- The maximum revenue opportunity if you achieved 100% market share
- No geographic, regulatory, or capability constraints
- "If everyone who could possibly use this bought it"
- Usually measured globally or for entire addressable population

**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**:
- The portion of TAM you can realistically serve with your current/planned business model
- Apply real constraints: geography, regulations, capabilities, channels
- "The subset of TAM we can actually reach"
- Typically 10-40% of TAM for most businesses

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**:
- The portion of SAM you can realistically capture in near-term (3-5 years)
- Consider competition, resources, market share dynamics
- "What we can actually win"
- Typically 1-10% of SAM for new entrants, higher for established players

### Calculation Approaches

**Method 1: Top-Down (Market-Based)**

Start with the total market and filter down:

```
TAM = Total Market Size (from industry reports)
SAM = TAM × Geographic Reach % × Segment % × Channel Access %
SOM = SAM × Realistic Market Share % × Adoption Rate %

Example - Cloud Accounting Software:
TAM = $12B (global accounting software market)
SAM = $12B × 40% (English-speaking countries) × 30% (SMB segment) × 80% (cloud-ready) = $1.15B
SOM = $1.15B × 3% (market share Year 3) × 70% (adoption) = $24M
```

**Pros**: Fast, good for mature markets with data
**Cons**: Can be too optimistic, hides assumptions
**Best for**: Established markets, investor pitches, initial sizing

**Method 2: Bottom-Up (Customer-Based)**

Build from customer units and economics:

```
SOM = # Target Customers × Conversion Rate × Average Revenue Per User × Purchase Frequency

Example - B2B SaaS for Dentists:
Target Customers = 200,000 dentists in US
Conversion Rate = 5% (10,000 customers)
ARPU = $3,000/year
Purchase Frequency = Annual subscription
SOM = 10,000 × $3,000 × 1 = $30M

Then work backwards:
SAM = Total dentists who could use solution × ARPU
    = 200,000 × 10% (could use SaaS) × $3,000 = $60M

TAM = All dental practices globally × ARPU
    = 1,500,000 × 8% (could use) × $3,000 = $360M
```

**Pros**: Grounded in reality, unit economics clear
**Cons**: Requires good customer data
**Best for**: New products, detailed planning, operational forecasts

**Method 3: Value Theory (Value-Based)**

Based on value created for customers:

```
Market Size = # Potential Customers × Value Created per Customer × % of Value Captured

Example - Supply Chain Optimization Software:
Potential Customers = 50,000 manufacturers
Average annual cost savings per customer = $500,000
Typical SaaS pricing = 10-20% of value created
Market Size = 50,000 × $500,000 × 15% = $3.75B TAM

Then filter to SAM/SOM based on who you can serve
```

**Pros**: Justifies pricing, shows customer ROI
**Cons**: Hard to quantify value created
**Best for**: New categories, value selling, pricing strategy

### Best Practice: Use Multiple Methods

Always triangulate with 2-3 methods:

```markdown
## Market Size Triangulation

**Top-Down**: $24M SOM
**Bottom-Up**: $30M SOM
**Value Theory**: $27M SOM

**Consensus Estimate**: $25-30M SOM (midpoint: $27.5M)
**Confidence**: Medium (all methods within 25% of each other)
```

If methods disagree by >50%, investigate assumptions.

## Data Triangulation Methodology

**Rule of Three**: Always use at least 3 independent sources for key numbers.

### Triangulation Process

1. **Gather multiple estimates**:
   ```
   Source A (Gartner): $15.2B market size
   Source B (IDC): $18.7B market size
   Source C (Forrester): $16.4B market size
   Source D (Company Analysis): $14.1B market size
   ```

2. **Assess source quality**:
   ```
   Source A (Tier 2, Weight 2x): $15.2B
   Source B (Tier 2, Weight 2x): $18.7B
   Source C (Tier 2, Weight 2x): $16.4B
   Source D (Tier 3, Weight 1x): $14.1B
   ```

3. **Calculate weighted average**:
   ```
   Weighted = (15.2×2 + 18.7×2 + 16.4×2 + 14.1×1) / (2+2+2+1)
           = (30.4 + 37.4 + 32.8 + 14.1) / 7
           = 114.7 / 7
           = $16.4B
   ```

4. **Check variance**:
   ```
   Range: $14.1B - $18.7B
   Spread: $4.6B (32% of midpoint)

   If spread >50% = Low confidence, need more data
   If spread 30-50% = Medium confidence
   If spread <30% = High confidence
   ```

5. **Document**:
   ```markdown
   Market Size: $16.4B (2024)
   Range: $14.1B - $18.7B
   Confidence: Medium (32% spread)
   Sources: 4 (2 Tier 2, 1 Tier 3)
   ```

### Handling Discrepancies

**Small Discrepancies (<30%)**:
- Normal variation
- Different definitions or years
- Use weighted average

**Medium Discrepancies (30-50%)**:
- Investigate definitions (TAM vs SAM?)
- Check timeframes (different years?)
- Check geography (global vs regional?)
- Note uncertainty in report

**Large Discrepancies (>50%)**:
- Red flag - don't proceed
- Understand root cause
- May need primary research
- Be transparent about uncertainty

## Market Sizing Techniques

### 1. Direct Market Sizing

Use when market data exists:

```
TAM = Industry Report Market Size
Sources: Gartner, IDC, Forrester, industry association

Example:
Gartner: "CRM software market = $69.5B in 2024"
```

### 2. Analogous Market Sizing

Use when direct data unavailable, analogous market exists:

```
New Market ≈ Analogous Market × Adjustment Factor

Example - Veterinary Practice Management Software:
Analogous: Dental Practice Management = $2.1B
Adjustment: (# Vet clinics / # Dental clinics) × (Complexity factor)
         = (30,000 / 200,000) × 0.8 (less complex)
         = $252M estimated market
```

### 3. Replacement Market Sizing

For products replacing existing solutions:

```
Market = Existing Solution Spend × Replacement %

Example - Cloud replacing On-Premise:
Current on-premise software spend: $50B/year
Cloud replacement rate: 30% by 2025
Replacement market: $50B × 30% = $15B
```

### 4. Greenfield Market Sizing

For entirely new markets (no existing spend):

**Step 1: Identify affected population**
```
Example - New personal finance app
US adults with bank accounts: 250M
Target: Adults 25-45: 95M (38%)
```

**Step 2: Estimate adoption curve**
```
Use analogous technology adoption:
Smartphone apps hit 30% in Year 5
Conservative: 10% adoption = 9.5M users
```

**Step 3: Monetization**
```
Revenue model: Freemium with 5% conversion
Paying users: 9.5M × 5% = 475,000
ARPU: $60/year
Market: 475,000 × $60 = $28.5M
```

### 5. Bottom-Up Unit Economics

Most credible for new ventures:

```
Step 1: Count target customers
- US companies with 50-500 employees: 650,000
- In target industries (tech, services): 195,000 (30%)
- With pain point we solve: 58,500 (30%)

Step 2: Estimate conversion
- Can reach via channels: 40,000 (68%)
- Realistic conversion: 5%
- Customer count: 2,000

Step 3: Calculate revenue
- Average Contract Value: $25,000/year
- SOM: 2,000 × $25,000 = $50M

Step 4: Work backwards for TAM/SAM
- SAM = All reachable × ACV = 40,000 × $25,000 = $1B
- TAM = All with pain point × ACV = 58,500 × $25,000 = $1.46B
```

## Growth Rate Calculation (CAGR)

**CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**:

```
CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / # Years) - 1

Example:
Market in 2020: $10B
Market in 2025: $18B
Years: 5

CAGR = ($18B / $10B)^(1/5) - 1
     = (1.8)^0.2 - 1
     = 1.1245 - 1
     = 0.1245 or 12.45%
```

**Forecasting with CAGR**:

```
Future Value = Current Value × (1 + CAGR)^Years

Example:
Current (2024): $18B
CAGR: 12.45%
Forecast 2030:
= $18B × (1.1245)^6
= $18B × 2.08
= $37.4B
```

**Sanity Checks**:
- 0-5% CAGR = Mature/slow-growing market
- 5-15% CAGR = Healthy growth market
- 15-30% CAGR = High-growth market
- 30%+ CAGR = Hypergrowth (validate carefully)

## Sensitivity Analysis

**Always show best/base/worst case**:

```markdown
## Sensitivity Analysis

### Base Case (Most Likely)
- TAM: $1.5B
- SAM: $450M (30% of TAM)
- SOM: $13.5M (3% of SAM)
- Assumptions: 25% adoption, 3% share, $600 ARPU

## Common Market Sizing Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Confusing TAM/SAM/SOM

**Wrong**:
```
"Our TAM is every company in the US" (200M companies)
```

**Right**:
```
TAM: Companies with 10+ employees in target industries ($2.4B)
SAM: Companies we can reach with our channels ($720M)
SOM: Realistic capture in Year 3 ($21.6M at 3% share)
```

### Mistake 2: Unrealistic Market Share

**Wrong**:
```
"We'll capture 25% market share in Year 2"
(Ignores competition, switching costs, sales capacity)
```

**Right**:
```
Year 1: 0.5% (early adopters only)
Year 2: 1.5% (growth from proof points)
Year 3: 3.0% (established presence)
(New entrants rarely exceed 5% before Year 5)
```

### Mistake 3: Top-Down Only

**Wrong**:
```
"$50B market, we'll get 1% = $500M"
(No validation of how to achieve this)
```

**Right**:
```
Top-Down: 1% of $50B = $500M
Bottom-Up: 50,000 customers × $10k ACV = $500M
Validation: Both methods agree, confidence is higher
```

### Mistake 4: Cherry-Picking Data

**Wrong**:
```
"One analyst says $100B, one says $20B - let's use $100B"
```

**Right**:
```
Source A: $100B (includes adjacent markets, global)
Source B: $20B (target market only, US)
Apples-to-apples: Our market is $20B
```

### Mistake 5: Stale Data

**Wrong**:
```
"Market was $10B in 2018" (using in 2024 analysis)
```

**Right**:
```
2018: $10B
2024 (projected with CAGR): $15.8B
Source recency: <2 years preferred, <5 years max
```

### Mistake 6: Ignoring Market Maturity

**Wrong**:
```
"Market growing 40% CAGR for last 5 years, assume same for next 5"
```

**Right**:
```
Historical: 40% CAGR (2018-2023)
Future: 15% CAGR (2024-2029)
Rationale: Market maturing, base effect, competitive saturation
```
