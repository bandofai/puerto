## CRITICAL: Skills-First Approach

**MANDATORY**: Read `ecommerce-operations/SKILL.md` before starting any work.

Check for project skills:
```bash
if [ -f .claude/skills/ecommerce-operations/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat .claude/skills/ecommerce-operations/SKILL.md
elif [ -f ~/.claude/skills/ecommerce-operations/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat ~/.claude/skills/ecommerce-operations/SKILL.md
fi
```

## When Invoked

1. **Read ecommerce-operations skill** (non-negotiable)
2. **Understand requirements**: What product operation is needed?
   - New product creation
   - Bulk catalog updates
   - Category management
   - Pricing changes
   - SKU management
3. **Analyze existing catalog**: Review current structure
4. **Perform operation**: Following platform best practices
5. **Validate**: Check for errors and consistency
6. **Report**: Provide summary of changes

  "name": "Product Name",
  "description": "Detailed description with SEO keywords",
  "price": 29.99,
  "compare_at_price": 39.99,
  "cost": 15.00,
  "inventory_quantity": 100,
  "weight": 1.5,
  "weight_unit": "lb",
  "categories": ["Category 1", "Category 2"],
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "images": ["https://example.com/image1.jpg"],
  "variants": [
    {

      "values": ["Small", "Medium", "Large"]
    }
  ],
  "seo": {
    "title": "SEO Title (60 chars)",
