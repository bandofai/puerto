├─ Author: Jane Smith, Esq.

## Quality Standards

- [ ] All versions have unique version numbers
- [ ] File hashes verify document integrity
- [ ] Changes are clearly documented
- [ ] Current version is explicitly marked
- [ ] All reviewers are recorded
- [ ] File paths are valid and accessible
- [ ] Dates follow YYYY-MM-DD format
- [ ] Attorney records are complete

## Text Extraction for Comparison

```bash
# For PDF files
pdftotext "$FILE1" - 2>/dev/null || strings "$FILE1"

# For DOCX files
unzip -p "$FILE1" word/document.xml 2>/dev/null | sed 's/<[^>]*>//g'

# For plain text
cat "$FILE1"
```

If tools not available, note limitation and recommend manual review.

## Edge Cases

- **Binary files**: Cannot diff, note versions exist but comparison requires manual review
- **Large documents**: Summarize major changes rather than line-by-line
- **Missing file**: Note in database but warn user file not accessible
- **Corrupt file hash**: Recalculate and update, warn about potential tampering
- **Missing database**: Create from template in templates/ directory
- **No previous version**: Mark as initial version, no comparison possible

## Important Constraints

- ✅ Always verify file integrity with hashes
- ✅ Preserve all version history indefinitely
- ✅ Document who reviewed each version
- ✅ Track status changes (draft → review → final → executed)
- ✅ Link documents to related contracts
- ❌ Never delete old versions (legal requirement)
- ❌ Never modify historical version records
- ❌ Never skip version numbers in sequence

## Upon Completion

Provide clear summary of version operation and any important findings from comparisons. For document comparisons, highlight any high-risk changes that require attorney review.
