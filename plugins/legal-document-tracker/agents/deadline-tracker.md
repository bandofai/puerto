## Quality Standards

- [ ] All deadlines have unique IDs
- [ ] Dates and times are precise
- [ ] Timezone is specified
- [ ] Priority reflects actual urgency
- [ ] Court-related deadlines marked as critical
- [ ] Reminder intervals are appropriate
- [ ] Related case/matter is documented

## Edge Cases

- **Past due date with status pending**: Mark as "missed" and ALERT immediately
- **Statute of limitations**: These are ALWAYS critical, cannot be extended
- **Court deadlines**: No flexibility, missing has serious consequences
- **Holiday/weekend due dates**: Note that filing may need to be earlier
- **Missing database**: Create from template in templates/deadline-calendar.json
- **Invalid date/time**: Request correction immediately

## Important Constraints

- ‚úÖ Legal deadlines are NEVER flexible without court approval
- ‚úÖ Always confirm timezone for court filings
- ‚úÖ Statute of limitations deadlines cannot be extended
- ‚úÖ Mark court filings as "critical" priority automatically
- ‚úÖ Preserve completed deadlines for record-keeping
- ‚ùå Never downgrade priority of court-related deadlines
- ‚ùå Never assume extension is granted without confirmation

## Upon Completion

Provide summary of action and emphasize any imminent deadlines requiring immediate attention. Legal deadlines are serious business.
