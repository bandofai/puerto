# Legal Document Management Skill

**Expert patterns for contract tracking, deadline management, and legal document version control**

---

## Overview

Legal document management requires precision, comprehensive record-keeping, and proactive deadline monitoring. This skill codifies best practices from legal professionals for managing contracts, deadlines, and document versions.

---

## Part 1: Contract Management

### Contract Lifecycle

```
Draft → Review → Negotiation → Execution → Active → Renewal/Expiration
```

### Essential Contract Data

**Minimum Required**:
- Unique identifier
- Contract type (employment, rental, service, insurance, etc.)
- Parties involved
- Start and end dates
- Auto-renewal status
- Notice requirements
- File location

**Highly Recommended**:
- Key terms and conditions
- Financial terms (amounts, payment schedule)
- Termination clauses
- Renewal history
- Related documents
- Attorney/contact responsible

### Expiration Alert System

**Industry Standard**: 90-60-30-7 day alerts

- **90 days**: Initial planning notice
  - Review contract terms
  - Decide: renew, renegotiate, or terminate
  - Begin research for alternatives if not renewing

- **60 days**: Action preparation
  - If terminating: Draft termination notice
  - If renewing: Begin renewal negotiations
  - Gather required documentation

- **30 days**: Critical action period
  - Most contracts require 30-60 days notice
  - This is often the last opportunity to give notice
  - Missing this may auto-renew unfavorable contracts

- **7 days**: Emergency alert
  - If action not taken, likely too late
  - Immediate escalation required
  - Document why action was delayed

### Contract Categories

**Employment Contracts**:
- Employment agreements
- Contractor agreements
- Non-compete agreements
- Stock option agreements

**Real Estate**:
- Leases (residential, commercial)
- Purchase agreements
- Property management contracts

**Services**:
- Internet/phone/utilities
- Subscription services
- Professional services (legal, accounting)
- Maintenance agreements

**Insurance**:
- Health insurance
- Auto insurance
- Life insurance
- Professional liability

**Business Agreements**:
- Vendor contracts
- Client agreements
- Partnership agreements
- Licensing agreements

### Auto-Renewal Considerations

**Contracts with auto-renewal require special handling**:

1. **Notice Period**: Track notice deadline, not contract end date
   - Example: Contract ends Dec 31, requires 60 days notice
   - Alert date: Nov 1 (not Dec 31)

2. **Cancellation Process**: Document how to cancel
   - Written notice required?
   - Specific recipient?
   - Certified mail necessary?
   - Online cancellation available?

3. **Penalties**: Note cancellation fees or penalties

### Contract Database Best Practices

**Organization**:
```
~/.legal-docs/
├── contracts.json          # Master contract database
├── contracts/              # Actual contract files
│   ├── employment/
│   ├── rental/
│   ├── services/
│   └── insurance/
├── deadlines.json          # Legal deadlines
└── versions.json           # Document version history
```

**Backup Strategy**:
- Keep database in version control (git)
- Regular automated backups
- Store actual contracts in multiple locations
- Cloud backup for critical documents

---

## Part 2: Legal Deadline Management

### Deadline Categories

**Court-Related** (ALWAYS CRITICAL):
- Filing deadlines
- Response deadlines
- Discovery deadlines
- Hearing dates
- Trial dates

**Statutory**:
- Statute of limitations
- Tax filing deadlines
- Regulatory compliance deadlines
- Annual report filings

**Contractual**:
- Performance deadlines
- Delivery dates
- Payment due dates
- Notice deadlines

**Administrative**:
- License renewals
- Registration renewals
- Certification deadlines

### Deadline Alert Frequency

**Court/Statutory Deadlines**: 30-14-7-3-1-0 days
- These are INFLEXIBLE
- Missing them has serious consequences
- More frequent alerts appropriate

**Contractual Deadlines**: 30-14-7 days
- May have some flexibility
- Less frequent alerts acceptable

**Administrative Deadlines**: 60-30-7 days
- Usually can be extended
- Standard alert frequency sufficient

### Priority Levels

**Critical**:
- Court filing deadlines
- Statute of limitations
- Non-negotiable regulatory deadlines
- Consequences: Legal liability, case dismissal, penalties

**High**:
- Important contractual deadlines
- Response deadlines with consequences
- Tax filing deadlines
- Consequences: Financial penalties, contract breach

**Medium**:
- Standard compliance deadlines
- Routine filing deadlines
- Administrative renewals
- Consequences: Inconvenience, administrative fees

**Low**:
- Internal deadlines
- Soft targets
- Planning milestones
- Consequences: Minimal

### Deadline Documentation

**Required Information**:
- Exact date and time (including timezone)
- What must be done
- Who is responsible
- Related case/matter reference
- Consequences of missing
- Method of completion (file in court, mail, email, etc.)

**Optional but Recommended**:
- Prerequisites or dependencies
- Estimated time to complete
- Resources needed
- Previous similar deadlines for reference

### Extension Management

**Requesting Extensions**:
1. Request EARLY (don't wait until last minute)
2. Document reason for extension
3. Propose specific new date
4. Get written approval
5. Update deadline database immediately

**Never Assume**:
- Extension is granted until confirmed in writing
- Oral agreement is sufficient
- Court will automatically grant extension
- Other party will be flexible

## Part 3: Document Version Control

### Version Numbering System

**Standard Convention**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

**MAJOR** (1.0 → 2.0):
- Significant substantive changes
- Different agreement terms
- Change in parties
- Complete rewrite

**MINOR** (1.0 → 1.1):
- Moderate changes to terms
- Additional clauses
- Modified conditions
- Negotiated amendments

**PATCH** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1):
- Typo corrections
- Formatting changes
- Non-substantive edits
- Clarifications without changing meaning

**Examples**:
- Initial draft: 1.0
- After adding non-compete: 1.1
- After fixing typos: 1.1.1
- Complete renegotiation: 2.0

### Version Status Workflow

```
Draft → Internal Review → Client Review → Negotiation → Final → Executed
```

**Draft**: Work in progress, not yet reviewed
**Internal Review**: Being reviewed by your attorney/team
**Client Review**: Sent to client for review
**Negotiation**: Active back-and-forth modifications
**Final**: Agreed upon, ready for signatures
**Executed**: Fully signed by all parties

### Change Documentation

**Every version MUST document**:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Who requested the change
- Who made the change
- Who reviewed the change

**Example**:
```
Version 1.2 changes:
- Added Section 7: Non-compete clause (requested by employer, drafted by J. Smith, reviewed by client)
- Increased salary in Section 3.1 from $80k to $85k (negotiated with client)
- Changed benefits effective date from 90 days to immediate (client request)
```

### File Integrity Verification

**Use hashes to verify document integrity**:

```bash
# Generate hash
sha256sum document.pdf > document.pdf.sha256

# Verify later
sha256sum -c document.pdf.sha256
```

**Why this matters**:
- Proves document hasn't been tampered with
- Required for legal proceedings
- Validates authenticity
- Detects corruption

### Comparison Best Practices

**When Comparing Versions**:

1. **Identify document type** (PDF, DOCX, TXT)

2. **Extract text appropriately**:
   - PDF: Use pdftotext or similar
   - DOCX: Extract from XML
   - Plain text: Direct comparison

3. **Focus on substantive changes**:
   - New or removed sections
   - Modified terms or amounts
   - Changed dates or parties
   - Added/removed conditions

4. **Ignore formatting differences**:
   - Font changes
   - Spacing adjustments
   - Page breaks
   - Headers/footers (unless substantive)

5. **Highlight risk areas**:
   - Financial terms
   - Liability clauses
   - Termination conditions
   - Non-compete/confidentiality

6. **Present clearly**:
   - Added sections (green/+)
   - Removed sections (red/-)
   - Modified sections (yellow/~)
   - Unchanged sections (summary only)

### Attorney Directory Integration

**Maintain comprehensive attorney records**:

**Required Fields**:
- Name and title
- Firm/organization
- Contact information (phone, email)
- Practice areas/specialties
- Bar number and jurisdiction

**Recommended Fields**:
- Office address
- Assistant/paralegal contact
- Hourly rate or fee structure
- Languages spoken
- Years of experience
- Notable cases/expertise
- Availability/response time
- Client ID or matter numbers

**Use Cases**:
- Quick contact lookup
- Finding specialist for specific issue
- Tracking which attorney handled which document
- Maintaining relationship history
- Referral tracking

├── contracts.json
├── deadlines.json
└── case-files/
```

### JSON Schema Standards

**contracts.json**:
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "contracts": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["id", "type", "title", "party", "startDate", "status"],
        "properties": {
          "id": {"type": "string", "pattern": "^contract-[0-9]+$"},
          "type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["employment", "rental", "service", "insurance", "other"]},
          "title": {"type": "string"},
          "party": {"type": "string"},
          "startDate": {"type": "string", "format": "date"},
          "endDate": {"type": "string", "format": "date"},
          "autoRenew": {"type": "boolean"},
          "noticeRequired": {"type": "number"},
          "status": {"type": "string", "enum": ["active", "expiring-soon", "expired", "renewed"]},
          "location": {"type": "string"}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Backup and Security

**Backup Strategy**:
- **Daily**: Automated backup of JSON databases
- **Weekly**: Full backup including document files
- **Monthly**: Verify backup integrity
- **Quarterly**: Test backup restoration

**Security Measures**:
- Encrypt sensitive documents at rest
- Use secure cloud storage with encryption
- Limit access to authorized individuals only
- Use strong passwords/2FA for legal document storage
- Shred physical copies securely when no longer needed

**NEVER**:
- Store unencrypted legal documents in public cloud
- Email sensitive contracts without encryption
- Use weak passwords for legal document access
- Share attorney-client privileged information broadly

## Part 5: Workflows

### Adding New Contract Workflow

1. **Receive executed contract**
2. **Create unique ID**: contract-XXX
3. **File physically**: Save to appropriate directory
4. **Extract key data**:
   - Parties
   - Dates
   - Terms
   - Renewal conditions
5. **Add to database**: contracts.json
6. **Calculate alerts**: Based on expiration/notice period
7. **Link related documents**: Previous versions, related agreements
8. **Set calendar reminders**: For alert dates
9. **Verify backup**: Ensure contract is backed up

### Deadline Monitoring Workflow

**Daily**:
1. Check for deadlines in next 7 days
2. Verify status of today's deadlines
3. Alert for any critical items

**Weekly**:
1. Review deadlines for next 30 days
2. Plan resources needed
3. Confirm responsibility assignments

**Monthly**:
1. Review all upcoming deadlines for next 90 days
2. Look for conflicts or resource constraints
3. Update priority levels as needed

### Version Control Workflow

**When Receiving New Version**:
1. **Verify receipt**: Confirm file received and opens correctly
2. **Generate hash**: Calculate SHA-256 hash
3. **Assign version number**: Follow versioning convention
4. **Compare to previous**: If previous version exists
5. **Document changes**: Record what changed and why
6. **Update database**: Add to versions.json
7. **Archive old version**: Keep but mark as superseded
8. **Update related records**: Link to contracts if applicable
9. **Notify stakeholders**: If significant changes

## Part 6: Best Practices

### Contract Management

✅ **Do**:
- Review contracts thoroughly before execution
- Keep originals in secure location
- Set alerts well in advance of deadlines
- Document all amendments and modifications
- Maintain complete contract history
- Back up regularly

❌ **Don't**:
- Sign without reading completely
- Rely on memory for important dates
- Ignore auto-renewal clauses
- Discard old versions
- Store only digital or only physical (keep both)
- Wait until last minute to review expiring contracts

### Deadline Management

✅ **Do**:
- Enter deadlines immediately when received
- Set multiple reminders
- Include time and timezone
- Document method of completion
- Verify completion and document
- Request extensions early if needed

❌ **Don't**:
- Trust memory for important deadlines
- Assume extensions will be granted
- Wait until deadline day to start work
- Ignore non-court deadlines as "flexible"
- Fail to document completed deadlines
- Rely on single reminder

### Document Version Control

✅ **Do**:
- Keep every version indefinitely
- Document all changes clearly
- Use consistent version numbering
- Generate file integrity hashes
- Track who reviewed each version
- Compare versions before signing

❌ **Don't**:
- Delete old versions to "save space"
- Reuse version numbers
- Skip documenting changes
- Assume versions are identical
- Trust version comparison to catch everything
- Sign without careful review of changes

## Part 7: Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Employment Contract Expiring

**30 days before expiration**:
- Alert received
- Decide: renew, renegotiate, or leave
- If leaving: Draft resignation letter
- If staying: Begin renewal discussion

**Actions**:
1. Review current contract terms
2. Research market rates
3. Prepare negotiation points if desired
4. Schedule meeting with employer
5. Document decision and next steps

### Scenario 2: Missing Court Deadline

**EMERGENCY PROTOCOL**:
1. **Immediate notification**: Inform attorney/client
2. **Assess consequences**: What is the impact?
3. **Explore remedies**:
   - Motion for extension (explain circumstances)
   - Emergency filing
   - Protective actions
4. **Document thoroughly**: Why missed, what done to remedy
5. **Implement prevention**: Additional safeguards

**Prevention**:
- Multiple calendar systems
- Multiple alert methods
- Clear responsibility assignment
- Backup person monitoring
- Daily deadline review

### Scenario 3: Contract Dispute Over Terms

**Version control saves the day**:
1. **Retrieve all versions**: From version database
2. **Compare disputed section**: Show evolution
3. **Verify integrity**: Check file hashes
4. **Document review history**: Who saw what when
5. **Present evidence**: Dated versions with hashes prove what was agreed

**Why this matters**:
- Proves terms at time of signature
- Shows good faith
- Defeats claims of modification
- Provides clear timeline

## Part 8: Tools and Automation

### Recommended Tools

**Document Management**:
- PDF tools: pdftotext, pdftk
- DOCX tools: pandoc, docx2txt
- Comparison: diff, Beyond Compare, DeltaWalker
- Hashing: sha256sum, md5sum

**Database**:
- jq: JSON manipulation
- sqlite3: Alternative to JSON for complex queries
- git: Version control for databases

**Reminders**:
- Calendar integration (iCal, Google Calendar)
- Email alerts
- SMS/push notifications for critical deadlines
- Cron jobs for daily checks

### Automation Opportunities

**Daily Checks**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check deadlines and contracts daily

# Check for critical deadlines
CRITICAL=$(jq '.deadlines[] | select(.dueDate <= "'$(date -d '+3 days' +%Y-%m-%d)'")' ~/.legal-docs/deadlines.json)
if [ -n "$CRITICAL" ]; then
    echo "CRITICAL DEADLINES IN NEXT 3 DAYS:" | mail -s "URGENT: Legal Deadlines" user@example.com
    echo "$CRITICAL" | mail -s "Deadline Details" user@example.com
fi

# Check for expiring contracts
EXPIRING=$(jq '.contracts[] | select(.endDate <= "'$(date -d '+30 days' +%Y-%m-%d)'" and .status != "expired")' ~/.legal-docs/contracts.json)
if [ -n "$EXPIRING" ]; then
    echo "CONTRACTS EXPIRING IN NEXT 30 DAYS:" | mail -s "Contract Expirations" user@example.com
    echo "$EXPIRING" | mail -s "Contract Details" user@example.com
fi
```

**Backup Automation**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily backup of legal documents

BACKUP_DIR=~/Backups/legal-docs/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Backup databases
cp ~/.legal-docs/*.json "$BACKUP_DIR/"

# Backup documents (incremental)
rsync -av ~/.legal-docs/contracts/ "$BACKUP_DIR/contracts/"

# Verify backup
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Legal document backup successful: $BACKUP_DIR"
else
    echo "BACKUP FAILED!" | mail -s "ALERT: Backup Failure" user@example.com
fi
```

---

## Part 9: Legal Considerations

### Attorney-Client Privilege

**Protect privileged communications**:
- Mark documents as "Attorney-Client Privileged"
- Store separately from non-privileged documents
- Limit access strictly
- Never share without attorney approval
- Use encryption

### Document Retention

**How long to keep**:
- **Contracts**: Duration + statute of limitations (typically 6-7 years after end)
- **Court documents**: Permanently
- **Tax-related**: 7 years from filing
- **Employment records**: 7 years after termination
- **Real estate**: Permanently
- **Drafts and working copies**: While relevant, then can discard (except for litigation)

**Destruction**:
- Shred physical documents
- Securely delete electronic files
- Document destruction (what, when, by whom)
- Follow retention policy consistently

### Electronic Signatures

**Requirements for validity**:
- Intent to sign
- Consent to electronic signature
- Association with the record
- Record retention

**Best practices**:
- Use reputable e-signature platform (DocuSign, Adobe Sign)
- Maintain audit trail
- Ensure all parties consent to electronic method
- Keep copies of signed documents
- Verify signatures if authenticity questioned

---

## Summary

Effective legal document management requires:

✅ **Comprehensive tracking**: All contracts, deadlines, versions
✅ **Proactive alerts**: Multiple advance warnings
✅ **Complete documentation**: Who, what, when, why for every change
✅ **Secure storage**: Encrypted, backed up, access-controlled
✅ **Version control**: Never lose a version, always know what changed
✅ **Attorney integration**: Maintain directory, track responsibilities
✅ **Automation**: Daily checks, automated backups, calendar integration

**The cost of missing a legal deadline or losing a contract can be enormous. Invest in proper systems.**
