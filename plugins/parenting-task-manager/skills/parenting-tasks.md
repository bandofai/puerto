### Positive Communication Techniques

#### "I" Statements vs "You" Statements

**"You" Statements (Accusatory)**
- "You never put your dishes away!"
- "You're so lazy!"
- "You always forget your homework!"
- Creates defensiveness
- Damages relationship

**"I" Statements (Ownership)**
- "I feel frustrated when I see dishes left out because it makes more work for me."
- "I'm concerned about your effort level."
- "I noticed your homework is in your room. What happened?"
- Opens dialogue
- Problem-solving focus

**Formula**: I feel [emotion] when [behavior] because [impact].

#### Active Listening

**Components**
1. **Full Attention**: Face child, eye contact, put down phone
2. **Don't Interrupt**: Let them finish thoughts
3. **Reflect Back**: "What I hear you saying is..."
4. **Validate Feelings**: "That sounds frustrating."
5. **Ask Questions**: "Tell me more about that."

**Example Exchange**
```
Child: "I hate doing chores! It's not fair!"

Poor Response: "Life isn't fair. Just do it."

Active Listening Response:
- "You're feeling frustrated about chores." [reflect]
- "Tell me what feels unfair." [question]
- [Listen without defending]
- "I hear that you feel like you have more chores than your friends." [validate]
- "Let's talk about the chores and see if any adjustments make sense." [problem-solve]
```

#### Clear Expectations

**Effective Instructions**
- Specific, not vague
- One task at a time (young kids)
- Check understanding ("What are you going to do?")
- Set time frame ("before dinner")
- Follow through consistently

**Examples**

Vague: "Clean your room."
Specific: "Put your clothes in the hamper, toys in the bins, and make your bed. I'll check in 20 minutes."

Vague: "Be good."
Specific: "Walk inside the store, use indoor voice, stay next to the cart."

#### Natural and Logical Consequences
