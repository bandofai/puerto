## Heatmap and Session Analysis

### Heatmap Insights

**Click heatmaps**:
- Are CTAs being clicked?
- Are users clicking non-clickable elements? (confusion)
- Are important links getting attention?
- Are there "rage clicks"? (frustration)

**Scroll heatmaps**:
- Do users see key content? (fold analysis)
- Where do most users stop scrolling?
- Is important content below the fold?
- Do users scroll past CTAs?

**Move heatmaps** (mouse tracking):
- What attracts attention?
- What do users read carefully?
- Are they scanning or reading?

**Example insights**:
```
Heatmap Analysis: Pricing Page

Findings:
1. 73% of users don't scroll to see Enterprise plan
   ‚Üí Opportunity: Reduce page height or add visual cue to scroll

2. "Free Trial" button gets 12% of clicks, "Contact Sales" gets 45%
   ‚Üí Insight: Users prefer talking to sales over self-service
   ‚Üí Opportunity: Make sales contact more prominent

3. Rage clicks on FAQ section (not expandable)
   ‚Üí Pain point: Users expect interactive FAQ
   ‚Üí Opportunity: Make FAQ expandable/collapsible
```

### Session Recording Insights

**What to look for**:
- **Confusion**: Back-and-forth navigation, hovering uncertainty
- **Rage clicks**: Repeated clicking same element
- **Dead ends**: User reaches page with no clear next step
- **Form struggles**: Multiple attempts, field errors
- **Device issues**: Pinch-zoom on mobile (text too small)
- **Unexpected paths**: Users taking unusual routes

**Pattern recognition**:
```
Session Recording Analysis: Checkout Flow

Pattern 1: Cart Abandonment (28% of sessions)
- Trigger: See shipping cost
- Action: Close tab immediately
- Insight: Unexpected shipping cost causes abandonment
- Opportunity: Show shipping estimate earlier

Pattern 2: Form Errors (42% of completers)
- Trigger: Submit payment form
- Action: Error on credit card number field
- Insight: Formatting confusion (spaces or not?)
- Opportunity: Auto-format card number as user types

Pattern 3: Mobile Struggle (67% of mobile users)
- Trigger: Billing address form
- Action: Pinch-zoom to read fields
- Insight: Form fields too small on mobile
- Opportunity: Increase mobile field sizes to 44px minimum
```

---

## A/B Test Hypotheses

### Test #1: Checkout Form Optimization

**Hypothesis**: If we reduce checkout form from 10 fields to 5 fields (removing phone, company, optional fields), then completion rate will increase by 20% because each additional field reduces completion by 10% (industry research) and session recordings show users abandoning at field 6.

**Test design**:
- Control: 10 fields
- Variant: 5 fields (email, name, address, city, zip)
- Success metric: Checkout completion rate
- Sample size: 3,200 visitors per variant
- Duration: 14 days

---

### Test #2: Mobile Form Field Size

**Hypothesis**: If we increase mobile form field height from 32px to 44px and label size from 14px to 16px, then mobile conversion rate will increase by 12% because session recordings show 67% of users pinch-zooming (Apple HIG recommends 44px minimum touch targets).

**Test design**:
- Control: 32px fields, 14px labels
- Variant: 44px fields, 16px labels
- Success metric: Mobile conversion rate
- Sample size: 5,100 mobile visitors per variant
- Duration: 14 days
