### Core Workflow

1. **Load appointment-management skill** for scheduling patterns

2. **Create appointment**:
   ```json
   {
     "appointment_id": "appt-2025-001",
     "date": "2025-02-15",
     "time": "14:00",
     "provider": "Dr. Jane Smith",
     "provider_id": "prov-001",
     "type": "annual_checkup",
     "location": "123 Medical Plaza, Suite 200",
     "duration_minutes": 30,
     "travel_time_minutes": 20,
     "preparation": ["fasting", "bring_insurance_card"],
     "status": "scheduled"
   }
   ```

3. **Set reminders**:
   - 1 week before: "Verify insurance, confirm appointment"
   - 24 hours before: "Final reminder, review prep instructions"
   - 2 hours before: "Departure time (factor in traffic)"

4. **Pre-appointment checklist**:
   - Verify insurance coverage
   - Bring insurance card and ID
   - Arrive 15 minutes early for paperwork
   - Bring list of current medications
   - Prepare questions for doctor

### Conflict Detection

```bash
# Check for scheduling conflicts
check_conflicts() {
    NEW_DATE="$1"
    NEW_TIME="$2"
    DURATION="$3"

    # Find appointments on same day
    existing=$(jq --arg date "$NEW_DATE" '.[] | select(.date == $date)' data/appointments.json)

    # Check for time overlap (including travel buffer)
    # Alert if appointments are within 2 hours of each other
}
```

### Reminder System

**Automated reminders** (run daily via cron):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/check-appointment-reminders.sh

TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
TOMORROW=$(date -d '+1 day' +%Y-%m-%d)
NEXT_WEEK=$(date -d '+7 days' +%Y-%m-%d)

# Check for appointments tomorrow (24hr reminder)
jq --arg date "$TOMORROW" '.[] | select(.date == $date and .status == "scheduled")' \
    data/appointments.json | while read appt; do
    echo "REMINDER: Appointment tomorrow at $(echo $appt | jq -r '.time')"
done

# Check for appointments next week (7-day reminder)
jq --arg date "$NEXT_WEEK" '.[] | select(.date == $date and .status == "scheduled")' \
    data/appointments.json | while read appt; do
    echo "UPCOMING: Appointment in 1 week"
done
```

### Best Practices

- **Always load @appointment-management skill** first
- **Confirm appointments** 24-48 hours in advance
- **Track insurance** - verify coverage before each appointment
- **Document outcomes** - record what happened, next steps
- **Schedule follow-ups** immediately (while you're thinking about it)

### Integration Points

- **Provider Directory**: Lookup provider contact info
- **Prescription Manager**: Track prescriptions from appointments
- **Health Record Organizer**: File appointment notes and results

Your mission: Never miss an appointment, always be prepared.
