## Insurance and Billing

### Understanding Health Insurance

**Key Terms**

**Premium**
- Amount paid monthly for insurance coverage
- Paid regardless of whether you use services
- Often deducted from paycheck for employer plans

**Deductible**
- Amount you pay before insurance starts covering
- Typically resets annually (January 1)
- Example: $1,500 deductible means you pay first $1,500 of covered services

**Copayment (Copay)**
- Fixed amount paid for specific service
- Examples:
  - Primary care visit: $25
  - Specialist visit: $50
  - Emergency room: $250
- Copays may not count toward deductible (check plan)

**Coinsurance**
- Percentage you pay after meeting deductible
- Example: 80/20 means insurance pays 80%, you pay 20%
- Applied until out-of-pocket maximum reached

**Out-of-Pocket Maximum**
- Maximum you pay in a year for covered services
- Includes deductible, copays, coinsurance
- After reached, insurance pays 100%
- Example: $6,000 out-of-pocket max

**In-Network vs. Out-of-Network**
- In-network: Providers contracted with insurance (lower cost)
- Out-of-network: Not contracted (higher cost or not covered)
- Always verify provider is in-network before appointment

**Prior Authorization**
- Insurance approval required before certain services
- Needed for: Expensive medications, surgeries, imaging, specialists
- Provider's office usually handles this
- Can take days to weeks

### Insurance Card Information

**Front of Card**
- Member name
- Member ID number
- Group number (if applicable)
- Plan type (HMO, PPO, etc.)
- Effective date

**Back of Card**
- Customer service phone number
- Claims mailing address
- Pharmacy benefit manager info
- Website and mobile app

**Important Numbers**
- Customer service
- Mental health line (may be separate)
- Nurse hotline
- Pharmacy benefits

### Explanation of Benefits (EOB)

**What is an EOB?**
- Statement showing what insurance covered
- NOT a bill (says "This is not a bill")
- Shows:
  - Service date and provider
  - Amount charged by provider
  - Allowed amount (contracted rate)
  - Amount paid by insurance
  - Amount you owe
  - Applied to deductible/out-of-pocket

**How to Read an EOB**
```
Service: Office Visit
Provider: Dr. Smith
Date: 2025-01-15

Provider Charged: $200
Allowed Amount: $120 (contracted rate)
Plan Paid: $96 (80% after deductible met)
You Owe: $24 (20% coinsurance)

Applied to Deductible: $0 (already met)
Applied to Out-of-Pocket: $24
```

**What to Do with EOBs**
- Review for accuracy (correct services and dates)
- Compare to actual bill from provider
- File for records (organize by date)
- Keep for 1-3 years
- Check for denied claims (appeal if necessary)

### Billing and Claims

**Medical Bill Components**
- Provider charges
- Insurance adjustments
- Insurance payments
- Your responsibility (patient balance)

**When You Receive a Bill**
1. Wait for EOB first (don't pay immediately)
2. Compare bill to EOB
3. Verify services were received
4. Check for billing errors
5. Contact billing office with questions
6. Negotiate payment plan if needed

**Common Billing Errors**
- Duplicate charges
- Unbundling (charging separately for bundled services)
- Upcoding (billing for more expensive service)
- Services not received
- Out-of-network when you used in-network

**Disputing a Bill**
1. Contact provider's billing department
2. Explain discrepancy with EOB
3. Request itemized bill
4. Ask for billing review
5. Escalate to patient advocate if needed
6. Contact insurance if provider won't resolve

**Payment Options**
- Pay full amount (sometimes discount for prompt payment)
- Payment plan (interest-free is common)
- Financial assistance (ask about charity care)
- Medical credit cards (CareCredit, but watch interest)
- Negotiate lower amount (especially for uninsured)

### Insurance Coordination

**Primary vs. Secondary Insurance**
- If covered by multiple plans (e.g., through both spouses)
- Primary insurance pays first
- Secondary pays portion of remaining balance
- Coordination of benefits (COB) prevents overpayment

**Birthday Rule (Dependents)**
- Parent with earlier birthday = primary for children
- Month and day only (not year)
- Example: Mom born June 15, Dad born August 20
  - Mom's insurance is primary for kids

**When Coverage Changes**
- Starting new job (30-day enrollment)
- Losing coverage (COBRA continuation)
- Marriage/divorce (qualifying event)
- Birth/adoption (qualifying event)
- Update insurance cards with all providers

### Maximizing Insurance Benefits

**Annual Planning**
- Schedule preventive visits (usually 100% covered)
- Use FSA/HSA before expiration
- Complete high-cost procedures before year-end if deductible met
- Plan elective surgeries for early in year (build toward out-of-pocket max)

**Free Preventive Services** (Affordable Care Act)
- Annual physical exam
- Immunizations
- Screenings (blood pressure, cholesterol, cancer)
- Counseling (tobacco cessation, obesity)
- Women's health (mammogram, Pap smear, contraception)
- Children's wellness visits

**Using FSA (Flexible Spending Account)**
- Pre-tax money for medical expenses
- Use-it-or-lose-it (spend by year-end)
- Eligible expenses:
  - Copays and deductibles
  - Prescriptions
  - Dental and vision care
  - Medical equipment
  - Some over-the-counter items

**Using HSA (Health Savings Account)**
- Available with high-deductible health plans
- Pre-tax contributions
- Rolls over year-to-year (not use-it-or-lose-it)
- Can invest funds for growth
- Triple tax advantage (contribute, grow, withdraw tax-free for medical)
