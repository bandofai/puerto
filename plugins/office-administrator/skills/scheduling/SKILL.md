# Meeting Scheduling & Calendar Management Skill

**Production-tested patterns for professional meeting scheduling, calendar etiquette, and time zone handling**

This skill provides comprehensive best practices for scheduling meetings efficiently while respecting participants' time and managing complex time zone scenarios.

## Core Principles

### 1. Respect for Time
- Every meeting should have a clear purpose and agenda
- Default to shorter meetings (15-30 min when possible)
- No meetings before 9 AM or after 5 PM local time
- Protect focus time (no meetings during peak productivity hours)
- Always include buffer time between meetings

### 2. Clear Communication
- Meeting purpose stated in title and description
- Agenda shared in advance (ideally 24 hours)
- All participants understand their role
- Time zones explicitly stated for distributed teams
- Preparation requirements communicated early

### 3. Flexibility and Contingency
- Propose multiple time options
- Have backup plans for conflicts
- Allow rescheduling with reasonable notice
- Provide asynchronous alternatives when appropriate
- Accommodate different time zones fairly

## Meeting Types & Duration Guidelines

### Quick Check-ins (15 minutes)
**Best for**:
- Daily stand-ups
- Quick status updates
- Single-topic decisions
- Brief 1-on-1s

**Scheduling**:

- Cancel if no agenda items

**Format**:
```

Duration: 15 minutes
Time: 9:00-9:15 AM [TZ]
Recurring: Daily, weekdays

## Time Zone Management

### Time Zone Handling Best Practices

**Always Specify Zones**:
```
❌ Wrong: "Meeting at 2:00 PM"
✅ Right: "Meeting at 2:00 PM EST (11:00 AM PST / 7:00 PM GMT)"
```

**Use Standard Abbreviations**:
- EST/EDT: Eastern Time (US)
- CST/CDT: Central Time (US)
- MST/MDT: Mountain Time (US)
- PST/PDT: Pacific Time (US)
- GMT/UTC: Greenwich Mean Time / Coordinated Universal Time
- CET/CEST: Central European Time
- JST: Japan Standard Time
- AEST/AEDT: Australian Eastern Time

**Daylight Saving Considerations**:
- Note when DST transitions occur
- Use "ET" (Eastern Time) for ambiguous periods
- Double-check around DST change dates
- Confirm with participants in different zones

### Time Zone Conversion Examples

**US Cross-Country**:
```
Meeting: 2:00 PM EST
- 1:00 PM CST (Chicago)
- 12:00 PM MST (Denver)
- 11:00 AM PST (San Francisco)
```

**US-Europe**:
```
Meeting: 9:00 AM EST
- 2:00 PM GMT (London)
- 3:00 PM CET (Paris, Berlin)
- 4:00 PM EET (Helsinki)
```

**Global Team**:
```
Meeting: 10:00 AM EST
- 7:00 AM PST (San Francisco)
- 3:00 PM GMT (London)
- 11:00 PM JST (Tokyo - next day consideration!)
- 1:00 AM AEDT (Sydney - next day)
```

### Distributed Team Scheduling

**Finding Common Hours**:
1. List all participant time zones
2. Identify working hours overlap (9 AM - 5 PM each zone)
3. Find intersection of working hours
4. Rotate "inconvenient" times fairly

**Fairness Protocol**:
- Don't always favor one time zone
- Rotate meeting times quarterly
- Consider asynchronous alternatives
- Offer recording for those who can't attend

**Example Rotation**:
```
Q1: 8:00 AM PST (11:00 AM EST, 4:00 PM GMT)
Q2: 12:00 PM PST (3:00 PM EST, 8:00 PM GMT)
Q3: 6:00 AM PST (9:00 AM EST, 2:00 PM GMT)
Q4: 10:00 AM PST (1:00 PM EST, 6:00 PM GMT)
```

## Calendar Etiquette

### Scheduling Protocol

## Meeting Timing Best Practices

### Optimal Meeting Times

**Peak Focus Hours** (protect these):
- 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Best for deep work
- Avoid scheduling routine meetings here
- Reserve for creative/strategic work

**Good Meeting Times**:
- 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Pre-lunch
- 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM: Post-lunch focus
- Tuesday-Thursday: Best days

**Acceptable but Not Ideal**:
- 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM: Early birds only
- 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM: End of day fatigue
- Monday mornings: Catch-up time
- Friday afternoons: Winding down

**Avoid**:
- Before 8:00 AM: Too early
- 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch time
- After 5:00 PM: Personal time
- Friday after 3:00 PM: Weekend mode

### Meeting Spacing

**Buffer Time**:
```
✅ Good Schedule:
9:00-10:00 Meeting A
10:15-11:00 Meeting B (15 min buffer)
11:00-12:00 Focus work
12:00-1:00 Lunch
1:00-2:00 Focus work
2:00-2:30 Meeting C
2:45-3:15 Meeting D (15 min buffer)

❌ Bad Schedule:
9:00-10:00 Meeting A
10:00-11:00 Meeting B (no buffer)
11:00-12:00 Meeting C (meeting fatigue!)
12:00-12:30 Meeting D (no lunch!)
```

**Energy Management**:
- No more than 3 hours of meetings in a row
- Block focus time for actual work
- Protect lunch time
- Allow transition time between meetings

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Scheduling Errors

❌ **No Agenda**: Meetings without clear purpose waste time
✅ **Always include agenda**: Even for 15-min meetings

❌ **Too Long**: Default to 1-hour meetings
✅ **Right-sized**: Use 15, 30, or 45 min when possible

❌ **Back-to-Back**: No time between meetings
✅ **Buffer time**: 5-15 min between meetings

❌ **Wrong Time Zone**: "2 PM" without specifying zone
✅ **Explicit zones**: "2 PM EST (11 AM PST)"

❌ **Last Minute**: Scheduling with < 24 hours notice
✅ **Advance notice**: 2+ days for standard, 1+ week for important

❌ **No Prep Time**: Expecting instant participation
✅ **Preparation time**: Share materials 24+ hours ahead

❌ **Too Many Attendees**: 10+ people in working meeting
✅ **Right size**: Only required attendees

### Calendar Management Errors

❌ **Double Booking**: Accepting overlapping meetings
✅ **One at a time**: Decline or propose alternative

❌ **No Focus Blocks**: Every hour available for meetings
✅ **Protected time**: Block focus time on calendar

❌ **Ignoring Lunch**: Meetings during 12-1 PM
✅ **Lunch block**: Protect lunch time

❌ **Always Available**: Accepting all requests
✅ **Strategic no**: Decline when not necessary
