## Flight Selection & Optimization

### Flight Priority Matrix

**Tier 1 - Must Have**:
1. **Policy compliance**: Within approved class and fare limits
2. **Timing**: Arrives in time for commitments
3. **Safety**: Reputable carriers with good safety records

**Tier 2 - Strong Preference**:
4. **Direct flights**: Avoid connections when price difference < 20%
5. **Reasonable hours**: Avoid extreme early/late unless requested
6. **Loyalty programs**: Use preferred airlines for miles/status

**Tier 3 - Nice to Have**:
7. **Preferred aircraft**: Newer, more comfortable planes
8. **Seat selection**: Aisle/window preference
9. **Amenities**: WiFi, power outlets, entertainment

### Direct vs. Connection Decision Tree

```
Is direct flight available?
├─ Yes
│  ├─ Price difference < 20%? → Book direct
│  ├─ Price difference 20-40%?
│  │  ├─ Trip < 3 hours → Book direct (traveler time valuable)
│  │  └─ Trip > 3 hours → Consider connection
│  └─ Price difference > 40%? → Book connection (unless critical meeting)
└─ No → Find best connection with adequate layover
```

### Layover Time Guidelines

**Domestic Connections**:
- Same airline: 60 min minimum, 90 min recommended
- Different airline: 90 min minimum, 120 min recommended
- Terminal change: Add 15-30 min
- Large hubs (ATL, ORD, LAX): Add 15 min

**International Connections**:
- Same airline: 90 min minimum, 120 min recommended
- Different airline: 120 min minimum, 180 min recommended
- Customs/immigration: 150 min minimum
- Terminal change: Add 30 min

**Risk Factors** (add time):
- First flight delay-prone: +30 min
- Weather season: +30 min
- Peak travel times: +30 min
- Critical meeting after arrival: +60 min

### Flight Timing Optimization

**Morning Departure (6-9 AM)**:
- ✅ Pros: Fewer delays, arrive with full day ahead
- ❌ Cons: Early wake-up, rush to airport
- **Best for**: Same-day meetings, maximizing destination time

**Mid-Day Departure (10 AM-2 PM)**:
- ✅ Pros: Reasonable wake time, avoids rush hour
- ❌ Cons: Loses partial work day
- **Best for**: Afternoon/evening arrival, next-day meetings

**Afternoon Departure (3-6 PM)**:
- ✅ Pros: Full work day before departure
- ❌ Cons: Delayed arrival, higher delay risk
- **Best for**: Nearby destinations, informal schedule

**Evening/Red-Eye (7 PM+)**:
- ✅ Pros: No work day lost, sleep on plane
- ❌ Cons: Arrival fatigue, next day productivity impact
- **Best for**: Cross-country to early meetings, traveler preference

### Airline Selection Criteria

**Primary Factors**:
1. **Policy compliance**: Approved carriers only
2. **Route optimization**: Direct or best connections
3. **Schedule fit**: Timing aligns with needs
4. **Loyalty program**: Maximize miles/status if close price

**Quality Indicators**:
- On-time performance: > 80% ideal
- Customer service rating: 4+ stars
- Seat comfort: Check seat configuration
- Cancellation policy: Flexible when possible

**Cost Considerations**:
- Base fare + fees (baggage, seat selection)
- Refundability vs. price (worth premium if uncertain)
- Loyalty program value (status benefits, upgrades)
- Total trip cost (not just flight)

---

## Hotel Selection & Optimization

### Location Priority Framework

**Tier 1 - Critical**:
1. **Proximity to meetings**: < 15 min commute ideal
2. **Safety**: Research neighborhood crime stats
3. **24/7 access**: Can get in/out anytime

**Tier 2 - Important**:
4. **Transportation access**: Near transit or easy taxi
5. **Dining options**: Breakfast included or nearby restaurants
6. **Business amenities**: WiFi, workspace, business center

**Tier 3 - Preferred**:
7. **Fitness/wellness**: Gym, pool for work-life balance
8. **Loyalty program**: Points and status benefits
9. **Comfort**: Recent renovation, good reviews

### Location Analysis Process

**Map Critical Points**:
```
1. Locate all meeting venues on map
2. Identify geographic center
3. Check distance/time to each
4. Consider traffic patterns
5. Evaluate hotel options in area
```

**Proximity Calculation**:
- Walking distance: < 0.5 miles (10 min)
- Short taxi: 1-3 miles (5-10 min)
- Medium drive: 3-10 miles (15-30 min)
- Long commute: > 10 miles (avoid if possible)

**Safety Assessment**:
- Check hotel/neighborhood reviews
- Look for safety mentions
- Verify 24-hour front desk
- Check lighting and surroundings
- Research area crime statistics

### Hotel Budget Optimization

**Rate Types** (in order of preference):
1. **Corporate rate**: Use company code
2. **Government rate**: If eligible (nonprofits, government)
3. **AAA/AARP**: Membership discounts
4. **Loyalty program**: Points or member rates
5. **Online booking**: Compare rates
6. **Package deals**: Flight + hotel bundles

**Budget Tiers** (adjust by city):
- **Standard cities**: $100-150/night
- **Major metro**: $150-250/night
- **High-cost cities** (NYC, SF, etc.): $250-400/night
- **Budget constraint**: Consider suburbs, extended stay

**Value Calculation**:
```
Total Cost = (Nightly Rate + Taxes + Fees + Parking) × Nights + Transportation Cost

Example:
Hotel A: $180/night + $30 parking, 1 mile from meetings = $210 + $0 transport
Hotel B: $140/night + free parking, 10 miles from meetings = $140 + $50 taxi
Winner: Hotel A ($210 < $190 but saves time and hassle)
```

### Hotel Quality Indicators

**Reviews** (check multiple sources):
- Overall rating: > 4.0/5 required
- Business traveler reviews: Read specifically
- Recent reviews: Within 6 months
- WiFi quality: Mentioned positively
- Cleanliness: Consistent praise
- Noise level: Quiet rooms noted

**Red Flags**:
- Rating < 3.5/5

- Safety concerns mentioned
- Inconsistent service
- Hidden fees

**Amenities Checklist**:
- [ ] Free WiFi (reliable, fast)

- [ ] 24-hour front desk
- [ ] In-room safe

## Ground Transportation

### Decision Matrix by Scenario

**Rental Car** - Choose when:
- Multiple destinations (> 3 locations)
- Suburban/rural area with poor transit
- Extended stay (3+ days)
- Flexibility needed
- Cost-effective: < $50/day + parking < taxi costs

**Rideshare/Taxi** - Choose when:
- Urban area with good coverage
- Occasional trips (2-3 per day)
- No parking hassle
- Unfamiliar with driving area
- Cost: $20-40 per trip reasonable

**Public Transit** - Choose when:
- Excellent system (NYC, SF, Chicago, DC, Boston)
- Meetings near transit stations
- Cost-conscious ($2-5 per trip)
- Environmental preference
- Familiar with system or easy to learn

**Car Service** - Choose when:
- VIP traveler or client
- Airport transfers only (reliability critical)
- Company policy requires
- Multiple passengers
- Late night/early morning

### Rental Car Optimization

**Vehicle Class**:
- **Economy**: Standard choice, fuel efficient
- **Compact/Mid-size**: If economy uncomfortable
- **SUV**: Only if needed (weather, terrain, passengers)
- **Avoid**: Luxury, convertible (not reimbursable)

**Cost Optimization**:
```bash
Daily rate:     $45
Taxes (15%):    $7
Insurance:      $15 (if not covered by credit card)
Gas:            $30 (estimate)
Parking:        $25/day hotel + $20/day meeting venue
────────────
Total/day:      $142

Compare to rideshare: 4 trips × $30 = $120
Decision: Rideshare cheaper for < 5 trips/day
```

**Insurance Considerations**:
- Check credit card coverage (most include CDW)
- Verify personal auto insurance extends
- Decline if covered (save $15-25/day)
- Accept if not covered (risk management)

### Rideshare Best Practices

**Pre-trip Setup**:
- Download app (Uber, Lyft)
- Add payment method
- Verify account active
- Check coverage in destination city

**Cost Management**:
- Get estimates for key routes
- Consider multi-stop trips
- Avoid surge pricing (plan ahead)
- Use scheduled rides for airport

**Safety**:

- Share trip with colleague
- Use in-app calling
- Sit in back seat

### Airport Transportation

**Best Options by City Type**:

**Major Metro** (NYC, SF, Chicago):
- Public transit: Cheapest, reliable
- Shared shuttle: Good for unfamiliar travelers
- Taxi/rideshare: Convenience premium
- Rental car: Avoid (traffic, parking costs)

**Medium Cities**:
- Rideshare: Usually best balance
- Taxi: Similar cost, more available
- Rental: If needed for trip
- Hotel shuttle: Free, but inflexible

**Small Cities**:
- Rental car: Often necessary
- Rideshare: May be limited
- Hotel shuttle: Coordinate in advance
- Taxi: Limited availability
