## When Invoked

1. **Identify task type**:
   - Add new bill
   - Check upcoming bills
   - Log payment
   - View all bills
   - Get late payment alerts

2. **Load bill database**: Read `data/bills/bills.json`

3. **Perform action**:
   - Add bill: Create entry with deadline, amount, recurring info
   - Check upcoming: Calculate 7-day, 3-day, 1-day reminders
   - Log payment: Update status and confirmation date
   - View all: Display organized list
   - Check late: Find overdue bills

4. **Update database**: Save changes to JSON

5. **Provide summary**: Clear action confirmation

## Bill Database Schema

```json
{
  "bills": [
    {
      "id": "bill-001",
      "name": "Electric Bill",
      "category": "utilities",
      "amount": 150.00,
      "dueDate": "2025-11-15",
      "recurring": "monthly",
      "autoReminders": true,
      "status": "pending",
      "paymentHistory": [
        {
          "date": "2025-10-15",
          "amount": 145.00,
          "confirmationNumber": "CONF-12345"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Reminder Logic

**7 days before**: "Upcoming: {name} due on {date} - ${amount}"
**3 days before**: "Reminder: {name} due in 3 days - ${amount}"
**1 day before**: "URGENT: {name} due tomorrow - ${amount}"
**Day of**: "DUE TODAY: {name} - ${amount}"
**After due**: "LATE: {name} was due {days} ago - ${amount}"

## Recurring Bill Automation

For recurring bills:
- Auto-create next month's entry after payment
- Adjust amount if different from usual
- Track payment patterns
- Alert on unusual amounts (>20% difference)

## Annual Cost Summary

Calculate total annual spending:
```bash
# Group by category
categories = {}
for bill in bills:
    if bill.recurring == "monthly":
        annual = bill.amount * 12
    elif bill.recurring == "quarterly":
        annual = bill.amount * 4
    # ... add to category total
```

## Output Format

**Adding bill**:
```
‚úÖ Bill added: Electric Bill
Due: 15th of each month
Amount: $150.00
Next reminder: Nov 8 (7 days before)
```

**Upcoming bills**:
```
üìÖ Upcoming Bills (Next 7 Days)

Nov 15 - Electric Bill - $150.00 (3 days)
Nov 18 - Internet - $80.00 (6 days)

Total due: $230.00
```

**Payment logged**:
```
‚úÖ Payment recorded: Electric Bill
Amount: $150.00
Confirmation: CONF-12345
Next due: Dec 15, 2025
```

**Late alerts**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è OVERDUE BILLS

Water Bill - $65.00 (2 days overdue)
Phone Bill - $45.00 (5 days overdue)

Total overdue: $110.00
Action required: Pay immediately to avoid late fees
```

## Data Location

- Bills database: `plugins/bill-reminder/data/bills/bills.json`
- Reminders log: `plugins/bill-reminder/data/reminders/reminders.log`

## Edge Cases

- If bills.json doesn't exist, create with empty structure
- If due date is invalid, ask for correct format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- If payment amount differs from bill amount, ask for confirmation
- If recurring frequency unknown, default to "once"

## Quality Standards

- [ ] All dates in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Amounts are positive numbers
- [ ] Reminders calculated correctly
- [ ] Database saved after each change
- [ ] Clear status messages
- [ ] Late fees mentioned in alerts
