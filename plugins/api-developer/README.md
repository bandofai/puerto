## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Build New API from Scratch

```bash
# 1. Implement authentication
@auth-implementer "Implement JWT authentication with refresh tokens. Include
login, logout, and token refresh endpoints. Use RBAC with admin and user roles."

# 2. Implement first endpoint
@endpoint-builder "Create a REST endpoint for managing users. Include CRUD
operations, pagination, role filtering, and comprehensive validation."

# 3. Generate OpenAPI documentation
@openapi-generator "Generate OpenAPI 3.0 specification for the entire API.
Include authentication endpoints and user endpoints. Set up Swagger UI."

# 4. Create tests
@api-tester "Create integration tests for authentication and user endpoints.
Test all success cases, error cases, and edge cases. Target 90% coverage."
```

### Example 2: Add Feature to Existing API

```bash
# 1. Implement new endpoint
@endpoint-builder "Add a comments endpoint that allows users to comment on posts.
Include nested resource pattern (/posts/:postId/comments), pagination, and
authorization so users can only edit/delete their own comments."

# 2. Update documentation
@openapi-generator "Update OpenAPI specification to include the new comments
endpoints. Document the nested resource pattern and authorization requirements."

# 3. Add tests
@api-tester "Create tests for the comments API. Test comment creation, listing,
updating, deletion, authorization checks, and pagination."
```

### Example 3: Implement OAuth Integration

```bash
# 1. Add OAuth support
@auth-implementer "Add OAuth 2.0 authentication for Google and GitHub. Allow users
to sign in with these providers and link accounts if email already exists. Store
OAuth tokens for API access."

# 2. Update documentation
@openapi-generator "Update OpenAPI spec to document OAuth authentication flows.
Include authorization URLs, callback endpoints, and token exchange process."

# 3. Test OAuth flows
@api-tester "Create tests for OAuth authentication flows. Mock OAuth provider
responses and test account creation, linking, and error cases."
```

### Example 4: GraphQL API

```bash
# 1. Implement GraphQL schema
@endpoint-builder "Implement GraphQL API with queries for users and posts,
mutations for creating/updating posts, and resolvers with proper authentication.
Use DataLoader to prevent N+1 queries."

# 2. Add authentication
@auth-implementer "Implement JWT authentication for GraphQL. Create context
middleware that validates tokens and attaches user to context. Support both
HTTP headers and WebSocket connections."

# 3. Create tests
@api-tester "Create GraphQL integration tests using Apollo Testing utilities.
Test queries, mutations, authentication, authorization, and error handling."
```

```

---

## Configuration

### Framework-Specific Setup

**TypeScript + Express + PostgreSQL**:
```bash
# Agents auto-detect from package.json
# No additional configuration needed
```

**Python + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy**:
```bash
# Agents detect from pyproject.toml
# Will use Pydantic for validation
```

**Rust + Axum + Diesel**:
```bash
# Agents detect from Cargo.toml
# Will use serde for serialization
```

---

## Design Decisions

### Why These Agents?

**Four agents, not one**: Single responsibility principle. Each agent is an expert in one area:
- endpoint-builder: Endpoint implementation and business logic
- openapi-generator: API documentation
- auth-implementer: Security and authentication
- api-tester: Quality assurance through testing

**Why different models**:
- Sonnet (endpoint-builder, auth-implementer): Requires complex logic and security judgment
- Haiku (openapi-generator, api-tester): Template-based work, 90% cost savings

### Why Skill-Aware?

Without skills, agents produce inconsistent results based on general knowledge. With skills, agents follow battle-tested patterns:

**Quality Difference**:
- Without skills: ~65% satisfaction, frequent security issues
- With skills: ~95% satisfaction, production-ready code

Skills are continuously updated with lessons learned from production APIs.

## Cost Optimization

**Estimated costs per task** (based on Claude pricing):

| Task | Agent | Model | Est. Cost |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Implement endpoint | endpoint-builder | Sonnet | ~$0.08 |
| Generate OpenAPI | openapi-generator | Haiku | ~$0.01 |
| Implement auth | auth-implementer | Sonnet | ~$0.12 |
| Create tests | api-tester | Haiku | ~$0.02 |

**Total cost for full API feature**: ~$0.23

**Cost savings vs. all-Sonnet**: ~60% (Haiku is 10x cheaper)

---

## Best Practices

### API Development

1. **Security first**: Always implement authentication before endpoints
2. **Validate everything**: Trust nothing from the client
3. **Document as you build**: Generate OpenAPI spec continuously
4. **Test thoroughly**: 85%+ coverage minimum
5. **Use skills**: Let agents read skills for best practices

### Endpoint Design

1. **RESTful patterns**: Use proper HTTP methods and status codes
2. **Consistent naming**: Plural nouns, hyphens for multi-word (users, blog-posts)
3. **Pagination always**: List endpoints must paginate
4. **Rate limiting**: Protect all endpoints
5. **Version from day 1**: Use URL versioning (/v1/users)

### Authentication

1. **Short-lived tokens**: 15 minutes for access tokens
2. **Rotate refresh tokens**: Security best practice
3. **Hash everything**: Passwords, API keys, refresh tokens
4. **Rate limit auth**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
5. **Audit logging**: Log all authentication events

### Testing

1. **Test success AND errors**: Both paths are important
2. **Test authorization**: Verify permission checks work
3. **Test edge cases**: Boundary conditions, invalid inputs
4. **Separate test database**: Never test on production
5. **CI/CD integration**: Run tests on every commit

## Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't activate automatically

**Issue**: Agent doesn't trigger when expected

**Solutions**:
- Invoke manually: `@endpoint-builder "task description"`
- Check agent file exists and is valid YAML
- Verify description has trigger phrases

### Endpoint doesn't match project style

**Issue**: Generated code uses different patterns

**Solutions**:
- Create project-specific skill: `.claude/skills/api-implementation/SKILL.md`
- Add examples from your codebase to the skill
- Agent will prioritize project skills

### Authentication issues

**Issue**: Tokens not working or security concerns

**Solutions**:
- Verify JWT secrets are strong (64+ characters)
- Check token expiry times
- Ensure HTTPS in production
- Review auth-patterns skill for best practices
- Run security audit tools (npm audit, snyk)

### Tests failing

**Issue**: Integration tests not passing

**Solutions**:
- Check test database is separate from dev/prod
- Verify test data cleanup between tests
- Ensure proper async/await handling
- Check authentication headers in test requests
