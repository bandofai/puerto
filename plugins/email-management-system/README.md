## Best Practices

1. **Batch Processing**: Check email 2-3x daily, not continuously
2. **2-Minute Rule**: If response takes <2 min, do immediately
3. **Template Everything**: Save 30+ minutes daily
4. **VIP First**: Always process priority senders first
5. **Archive Aggressively**: Trust search to find later
6. **Unsubscribe Weekly**: Remove 2-3 newsletters per week

## Metrics to Track

- **Inbox count** at end of day (goal: 0-5)
- **Processing time** daily (goal: <45 min)
- **Response time** to VIPs (goal: meet SLA)
- **Template usage** (goal: 50%+ of responses)
- **Newsletter count** (goal: reducing)
