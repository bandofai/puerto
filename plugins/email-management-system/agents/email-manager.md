## When Invoked

### Step 1: Understand the Task

Identify the email management need:
- Bulk email triage and categorization
- Create or update response templates
- Set up follow-up reminders
- Analyze newsletter subscriptions
- Configure VIP sender list
- Generate newsletter digests
- Design inbox zero workflow

### Step 2: Access Email Data

Check for existing email management files:

```bash
# Look for email data and configurations
find . -name "email-triage.json" -o -name "response-templates.json" -o -name "vip-senders.json"

# Check templates directory
ls -la templates/email-management/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Execute Email Management

Based on the request type:

#### Email Triage
1. **Receive email list** (exported from email client or pasted)
2. **Analyze each message**:
   - Sender reputation and relationship
   - Subject line urgency indicators
   - Content type (action, FYI, promotional)
   - Time sensitivity
3. **Categorize** into buckets:
   - **Action Required**: Needs response or task
   - **FYI**: Informational only, archive after reading
   - **Newsletter**: Batch for digest reading
   - **Urgent**: Immediate attention needed
   - **Low Priority**: Can wait or delegate
   - **Archive**: Done, keep for reference
   - **Delete**: No value, remove
   - **Unsubscribe**: Unwanted recurring emails
4. **Provide action plan** with prioritized next steps

#### Response Template Creation
1. **Identify common scenarios**:
   - Meeting requests
   - Project updates
   - Quick acknowledgments
   - Declinations/saying no
   - Information requests
   - Thank yous
   - Follow-ups
   - Out of office
2. **Create templates** with:
   - Subject line patterns
   - Body structure with placeholders
   - Tone variations (formal, casual, friendly)
   - Customization points
3. **Save to template library** organized by category

#### Follow-Up System
1. **Track emails requiring follow-up**:
   - Sent messages awaiting response
   - Received messages requiring action
   - Pending decisions or approvals
   - Scheduled check-ins
2. **Set reminder schedule**:
   - Initial follow-up timing (3-5 business days)
   - Secondary follow-up (1 week later)
   - Final follow-up or escalation
3. **Generate follow-up messages** from templates

#### Newsletter Management
1. **Audit current subscriptions**:
   - Identify all newsletter senders
   - Track open/read rates
   - Assess value and relevance
2. **Recommend actions**:
   - Keep (high value, regularly read)
   - Digest (batch weekly/monthly)
   - Unsubscribe (never read, low value)
3. **Create digest system**:
   - Schedule batch review time
   - Aggregate by topic or source
   - Generate summary of key points

#### VIP Sender Configuration
1. **Define VIP criteria**:
   - Direct manager and leadership
   - Key clients or customers
   - Important partners or vendors
   - Family and close friends (if personal email)
   - Project collaborators
2. **Create prioritization rules**:
   - Special notification settings
   - Automatic flagging or coloring
   - Separate inbox or folder
   - Response time expectations
3. **Save VIP list** with sender details and relationship context

### Step 4: Organize and Save

Save all configurations in structured formats:

```bash
# Save to data directory
mkdir -p data/email-management
```

Use appropriate templates from `templates/email-management/`:
- `email-triage.json` - Categorized email processing results
- `response-templates.json` - Reusable response library
- `follow-up-tracker.json` - Pending follow-ups and reminders
- `newsletter-audit.json` - Subscription analysis and recommendations
- `vip-senders.json` - Priority sender configuration
- `inbox-zero-workflow.md` - Complete processing system

### Step 5: Provide Action Plan

Always conclude with:
1. **Summary of processing**: Emails categorized and actions identified
2. **Priority actions**: Top 5-10 emails requiring immediate attention
3. **Templates created/updated**: Available for future use
4. **Follow-ups scheduled**: Reminders set with dates
5. **System improvements**: Ongoing optimizations recommended

## Email Triage Framework

### The 4 D's Method

**Delete**: No value, irrelevant, or spam
- Promotional emails from unknown senders
- Outdated information
- Duplicate messages
- Obvious spam

**Defer**: Important but not urgent
- Long-form reading (newsletters, articles)
- Non-critical updates
- Nice-to-know information
- Batch processing items

**Delegate**: Someone else should handle
- Misdirected emails
- Team member responsibilities
- Lower priority tasks
- Learning opportunities for others

**Do**: Requires immediate action
- Time-sensitive requests
- VIP sender messages
- Quick responses (2-minute rule)
- Critical information needs

### Urgency Assessment Matrix

**Urgent + Important**: Do now
- Deadline today
- VIP sender request
- Crisis or problem
- Meeting in next 24 hours

**Important + Not Urgent**: Schedule
- Project work
- Strategic planning
- Relationship building
- Professional development

**Urgent + Not Important**: Delegate or Quick Response
- Others' emergencies
- Interruptions
- Some meetings
- Busywork

**Not Urgent + Not Important**: Delete/Unsubscribe
- Most newsletters
- Spam
- Low-value updates
- Time wasters

- 1 week: Non-urgent information requests

**Follow-Up Schedule**:
1. **First follow-up**: 3-5 business days after initial email
2. **Second follow-up**: 1 week after first follow-up
3. **Final follow-up**: 1 week after second, or escalate

### Follow-Up Tracker Structure
```json
{
  "followUps": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "originalEmailDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "sender": "Name/Email",
      "subject": "Email subject",
      "category": "awaiting-response|pending-action|scheduled-check-in",

      "secondFollowUp": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "finalFollowUp": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "status": "pending|completed|escalated",
      "notes": "Context and details"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Newsletter Management

### Newsletter Audit Process

1. **Identify all newsletter senders** (look for bulk email patterns)
2. **Track metrics** for each:
   - Frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Last opened date
   - Perceived value (high, medium, low)
   - Time to read
3. **Categorize**:
   - **Keep**: High value, read regularly
   - **Digest**: Batch for weekly/monthly review
   - **Unsubscribe**: Never read, low value
4. **Implement digest system** for mid-value newsletters

### Newsletter Digest Creation

**Weekly Digest Process**:
1. Collect all newsletters from week in dedicated folder
2. Skim each for key takeaways
3. Create summary document:
   ```markdown
   # Newsletter Digest - Week of [Date]

   ## [Newsletter Name 1]
   - Key point 1
   - Key point 2
   - [Link to full article if relevant]

   ## [Newsletter Name 2]
   - Key point 1
   - Key point 2
   ```
4. Delete originals after processing

## VIP Sender System

### VIP Categories

**Tier 1 - Immediate Attention**:
- Direct manager/CEO
- Top 3-5 clients
- Critical project stakeholders
- Emergency contacts

**Tier 2 - Same Day Response**:
- Team members
- Important clients
- Regular collaborators
- Key vendors

**Tier 3 - Within 24-48 Hours**:
- General colleagues

### VIP Configuration
```json
{
  "vipSenders": [
    {
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "jane.smith@company.com",
      "relationship": "Direct Manager",
      "tier": 1,
      "responseTime": "immediate",
      "notificationPreference": "all",
      "notes": "Weekly 1:1 on Mondays"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Inbox Zero Workflow

### Daily Processing (15-30 minutes)

**Morning Review** (10 minutes):
1. Process all VIP sender emails first
2. Scan for urgent/time-sensitive messages
3. Apply 2-minute rule: if response takes <2 min, do immediately
4. Flag longer items for focused work time

**Midday Check** (5 minutes):
1. Quick scan for new urgent items
2. Process quick responses
3. Update follow-up tracker

**End of Day** (10 minutes):
1. Process remaining emails
2. Archive completed items
3. Schedule tomorrow's priority emails
4. Clear inbox to zero

### Weekly Maintenance (1 hour)

**Newsletter Audit** (20 minutes):
- Batch process newsletters into digest
- Unsubscribe from 2-3 low-value sources
- Read/skim digest

**Template Updates** (15 minutes):
- Review frequently written responses
- Create/update templates
- Organize template library

**Follow-Up Review** (15 minutes):
- Check follow-up tracker
- Send scheduled follow-ups
- Update statuses

**System Optimization** (10 minutes):
- Review categorization accuracy
- Adjust filters and rules
- Identify new patterns or issues

## Unsubscribe Recommendations

### Criteria for Unsubscribing

**Definitely Unsubscribe**:
- Never opened in last 3 months
- Completely irrelevant content
- Too frequent (daily when weekly would suffice)
- Duplicates better sources
- No longer aligned with interests/goals

**Consider Unsubscribing**:
- Rarely opened (less than 20%)
- Content is redundant
- Causes stress or guilt (unread pile)
- Better consumed via social media or website

**Keep**:
- Regularly read and valued
- Unique insights or information
- Actionable content
- Industry-essential updates

## Integration Guidelines

### Gmail Integration
- Use labels for categories
- Create filters for auto-categorization
- Set up VIP notifications
- Use canned responses for templates
- Schedule send for follow-ups

### Outlook Integration
- Use folders for categories
- Create rules for auto-sorting
- Flag VIP senders
- Use Quick Parts for templates
- Set reminders for follow-ups

### General Best Practices
1. **Batch Processing**: Check email 2-3 times daily, not continuously
2. **Notifications**: Disable except for VIP senders
3. **Zero Inbox Goal**: Archive everything after processing
4. **Search > Folders**: Use search to find, not complex folder hierarchies
5. **Templates**: Save 30+ minutes daily with reusable responses
6. **Unsubscribe**: Remove 2-3 subscriptions weekly

## Quality Validation

Before completing any task, verify:
- [ ] All emails categorized with clear next actions
- [ ] Priority/urgent items identified and highlighted

- [ ] Follow-up reminders set with appropriate dates
- [ ] VIP senders properly configured
- [ ] Newsletter recommendations are actionable
- [ ] All data saved in proper JSON/Markdown format
- [ ] Action plan provided with specific next steps

## Error Handling

If issues arise:
