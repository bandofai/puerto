## Tracking Metrics

### Time-Based Metrics
```python
# Total immersion hours per skill
listening_hours = sum(activity['duration'] for activity in activities
                      if activity['skill'] == 'listening') / 60

reading_hours = sum(activity['duration'] for activity in activities
                    if activity['skill'] == 'reading') / 60

speaking_hours = sum(activity['duration'] for activity in activities
                     if activity['skill'] == 'speaking') / 60

writing_hours = sum(activity['duration'] for activity in activities
                    if activity['skill'] == 'writing') / 60

# Weekly/monthly totals
weekly_total = sum_by_week(activities)
monthly_total = sum_by_month(activities)

# Skill distribution
skill_distribution = {
    'listening': listening_hours / total_hours * 100,
    'reading': reading_hours / total_hours * 100,
    'speaking': speaking_hours / total_hours * 100,
    'writing': writing_hours / total_hours * 100
}
```

### Comprehension Tracking
```python
# Average comprehension by difficulty
def avg_comprehension_by_difficulty(activities):
    difficulty_groups = defaultdict(list)
    for activity in activities:
        if 'comprehension' in activity:
            difficulty_groups[activity['difficulty']].append(
                activity['comprehension']
            )

    return {
        diff: sum(comps) / len(comps)
        for diff, comps in difficulty_groups.items()
    }

# Comprehension trend over time
def comprehension_trend(activities):
    monthly = defaultdict(list)
    for activity in activities:
        month = activity['date'][:7]  # YYYY-MM
        if 'comprehension' in activity:
            monthly[month].append(activity['comprehension'])

    return {
        month: sum(comps) / len(comps)
        for month, comps in monthly.items()
    }
```

### Content Analysis
```python
# Most common content types
content_frequency = Counter(activity['type']
                           for activity in activities)

# Subtitle dependency
subtitle_usage = {
    'none': count_by_subtitle(activities, 'none'),
    'target': count_by_subtitle(activities, 'target-language'),
    'native': count_by_subtitle(activities, 'native-language')
}

# Difficulty distribution
difficulty_dist = Counter(activity['difficulty']
                         for activity in activities)
```

## Immersion Goals

    "nativeContent": 20,
    "noSubtitles": 5,
    "finishBook": true,
    "tutorSessions": 8
  }
}
```

## Progress Indicators

### Subtitle Reduction
```
Month 1: 100% with native subtitles

C2: Complex native content (literature, academic)
```

### Comprehension Growth
```python
# Target comprehension by level
comprehension_targets = {
    'A1': {'beginner': 80, 'intermediate': 40, 'advanced': 20},
    'A2': {'beginner': 95, 'intermediate': 70, 'advanced': 40},
    'B1': {'beginner': 100, 'intermediate': 85, 'advanced': 60},
    'B2': {'intermediate': 95, 'advanced': 80, 'native': 70},
    'C1': {'advanced': 95, 'native': 85},
    'C2': {'native': 95}
}
```

## Optimization Strategies

### Balanced Immersion
```
