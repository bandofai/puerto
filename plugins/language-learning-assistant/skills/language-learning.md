# Language Learning Skill

Comprehensive patterns for language acquisition, spaced repetition, proficiency assessment, and skill development across listening, speaking, reading, and writing.

## Language Acquisition Theory

### Second Language Acquisition (SLA) Fundamentals

#### Krashen's Hypotheses

**Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis**
- **Acquisition**: Subconscious, natural process (like children)
  - Through comprehensible input and meaningful interaction
  - Results in implicit knowledge
  - Enables fluent, automatic language use
- **Learning**: Conscious study of grammar rules
  - Through explicit instruction and memorization
  - Results in explicit knowledge
  - Useful for monitoring and editing

**Natural Order Hypothesis**
- Grammatical structures acquired in predictable order
- Independent of L1 (first language)
- Cannot be significantly altered by instruction
- Implications: Don't force structures before learner is ready

**Monitor Hypothesis**
- Learned rules act as "monitor" or editor
- Three user types:
  - Over-users: Constant self-correction (hinders fluency)
  - Under-users: Never monitor (many errors)
  - Optimal users: Monitor when appropriate
- Conditions for monitor use:
  - Sufficient time
  - Focus on form
  - Know the rule

**Input Hypothesis (i+1)**
- Acquire language through comprehensible input
- "i" = current level, "+1" = slightly beyond
- Formula: Optimal input = i+1
- Too easy (i): No progress
- Too hard (i+5): Incomprehensible, frustrating
- Just right (i+1): Challenging but understandable

**Affective Filter Hypothesis**
- Emotional factors affect acquisition
- High filter (stress, anxiety): Blocks input
- Low filter (relaxed, motivated): Allows acquisition
- Create low-anxiety learning environments

#### Comprehensible Input Principles

**Finding i+1 Content**
- Use context clues: images, gestures, cognates
- 80-90% comprehension sweet spot
- Build on known vocabulary and structures
- Gradual complexity increase

**Input Sources by Level**
- Beginner (A1-A2): Graded readers, children's books, slow podcasts
- Intermediate (B1-B2): Young adult fiction, news with subtitles, podcasts
- Advanced (C1-C2): Native content, literature, academic texts

**Scaffolding Techniques**
- Visual aids: Pictures, diagrams, videos
- Repetition with variation
- Simplified syntax initially
- Formulaic expressions (chunks)
- Cognitive support: Predictions, summaries

### Cognitive Processes

#### Working Memory and Language

**Phonological Loop**
- Holds verbal information (2-3 seconds)
- Critical for vocabulary learning
- Strategies to enhance:
  - Chunking: Group items (phone numbers)
  - Rehearsal: Mental repetition
  - Elaboration: Connect to meaning

**Cognitive Load Theory**
- Intrinsic load: Task complexity
- Extraneous load: Poor instruction design
- Germane load: Processing for learning
- Reduce extraneous, optimize germane

**Automaticity Development**
- Controlled processing → Automatic processing
- Requires extensive practice
- Frees working memory for higher-order tasks
- Examples: Reading fluency, common phrases

#### Memory Systems

**Declarative Memory (Explicit)**
- Semantic: Facts, vocabulary, grammar rules
- Episodic: Personal experiences with language
- Requires conscious recall

**Procedural Memory (Implicit)**
- Skills, habits, automatic processes
- Language production patterns
- Developed through practice, not study

**Optimal Learning Sequence**
1. Initial encoding (declarative)
2. Repeated retrieval practice
3. Proceduralization (automatic use)
4. Long-term consolidation

- Learning intensity (hours per week)
- Age (children vs adults)
- Prior language learning experience
- Individual aptitude and motivation

## Spaced Repetition Systems

### SM-2 Algorithm (SuperMemo 2)

#### Core Principles

**Forgetting Curve**
- Memory strength decays exponentially
- Without review: 50% forgotten in 24 hours
- Each review strengthens memory
- Optimal review just before forgetting

**Expanding Intervals**
- Review intervals increase after successful recall
- Contract after failed recall
- Adapts to individual item difficulty
- Maximizes retention, minimizes reviews

#### SM-2 Implementation

**Variables**
- EF (Easiness Factor): 1.3 to 2.5 (starts at 2.5)
- n (repetition number): 0, 1, 2, 3...
- I (interval in days): Time until next review

**Quality of Response (0-5)**
```
5 - Perfect response
4 - Correct after hesitation
3 - Correct with difficulty
2 - Incorrect but remembered
1 - Incorrect but seemed familiar
0 - Complete blackout
```

**Algorithm**
```
If quality < 3:
  n = 0
  I = 1
  EF = unchanged
Else:
  If n = 0: I = 1
  If n = 1: I = 6
  If n > 1: I = I[n-1] × EF

  n = n + 1
  EF = EF + (0.1 - (5 - quality) × (0.08 + (5 - quality) × 0.02))

  If EF < 1.3: EF = 1.3
```

**Example Progression**
```
Day 1: Learn new word (quality 4)
  n = 1, I = 1, EF = 2.5
  Next review: Tomorrow

Day 2: Review (quality 4)
  n = 2, I = 6, EF = 2.5
  Next review: Day 8

Day 8: Review (quality 4)
  n = 3, I = 6 × 2.5 = 15 days, EF = 2.5
  Next review: Day 23

Day 23: Review (quality 3 - difficult)
  n = 4, I = 15 × 2.4 = 36 days, EF = 2.4
  Next review: Day 59

Day 59: Review (quality 2 - forgot)
  n = 0, I = 1, EF = 2.4
  Next review: Day 60 (reset)
```

#### Modern SRS Enhancements

**Anki's Modified Algorithm**
- "Again" multiplier: 0% (resets to 1 day)
- "Hard" multiplier: 120% of previous interval
- "Good" multiplier: 250% (standard SM-2)
- "Easy" multiplier: Higher EF and bonus days

**Lapse Handling**
- Cards enter "relearning" after lapse
- Shorter intervals to rebuild memory
- Returns to review after successful relearning

**Optimal Daily Limits**
- New cards: 10-20 per day (sustainable)
- Reviews: No limit (must do all due)
- Balance prevents overwhelming queues

### Creating Effective Flashcards

#### Principles (20 Rules)

**1. Understand Before Memorizing**
- Build mental models first
- Connect to existing knowledge
- Don't memorize what you don't understand

**2. Minimum Information Principle**
- One fact per card
- Simple questions, simple answers
- Easier to remember, easier to review

**Bad**: "What are the conjugations of 'to be' in Spanish?"
```
ser - soy, eres, es, somos, sois, son
estar - estoy, estás, está, estamos, estáis, están
```

**Good**: Multiple cards
```
Card 1: I am (permanent state) → soy
Card 2: You are (permanent, informal) → eres
Card 3: I am (location) → estoy
Card 4: You are (location, informal) → estás
```

**3. Cloze Deletions for Context**
```
The cat [...] on the mat.
→ The cat sat on the mat.

Le chat est [...] sur le tapis.
→ Le chat est assis sur le tapis.
```

**4. Use Images**
- Visual memory is powerful
- Especially for nouns and concrete concepts
- Add context and emotion

**5. Avoid Lists**
- Lists are hard to remember
- Use enumerations instead
```
Bad: Name all Spanish articles
Good: How many definite articles in Spanish? → 4 (el, la, los, las)
```

**6. Context Clues**
- Provide enough context
- Not too much (minimum info)
- Example sentences help

```
"Schadenfreude" → ?
Better: German word for pleasure from others' misfortune → Schadenfreude
```

**7. Bidirectional Cards When Needed**
- Production: English → Spanish
- Recognition: Spanish → English
- Both have value, use strategically

**8. Personalization**
- Use sentences relevant to your life
- Add personal memories
- Emotional connections strengthen memory

**9. Mnemonic Techniques**
```
"Biblioteca" (library) → Picture books in "Bib" overalls in a "Teca" shop
"Embarrassed" (two 'r', two 's') → Really Red, Super Shy
```

**10. Audio for Pronunciation**
- Essential for speaking/listening skills
- Native speaker recordings
- Sentence-level, not just words

#### Card Types by Content

**Vocabulary Cards**
```
Front: [Image of apple]
       apple (English)
Back:  der Apfel (German)
       Audio: [pronunciation]
       Die Äpfel sind rot. (The apples are red.)
```

**Grammar Pattern Cards**
```
Front: Express obligation: I [...] study.
Back:  must / have to / need to
       I must study for the exam.
```

**Sentence Building Cards**
```
Front: Rearrange: want / I / learn / to / Spanish
Back:  I want to learn Spanish.
       Quiero aprender español.
```

**Translation Cards**
```
Front: ¿Dónde está el baño?
Back:  Where is the bathroom?
       [Audio pronunciation]
```

**Conjugation Cards**
```
Front: hablar (to speak) - yo form, present
Back:  hablo
       Yo hablo español. (I speak Spanish.)
```

### SRS Study Strategies

#### Daily Routine

**Morning Review Session (15-30 minutes)**
- Brain fresh for new material
- Learn 10-20 new cards
- Review due cards
- Before other language practice

**Evening Review Session (10-15 minutes)**
- Reinforce morning learning
- Review any due cards
- Lighter cognitive load acceptable

**Total Daily Time**: 30-60 minutes maximum
- Consistency > marathon sessions
- Daily practice essential for retention

#### Review Best Practices

**Rating Honestly**
- Grade based on actual recall
- Don't excuse errors ("I almost knew it")
- Failed recall = learning opportunity

**Focus During Reviews**
- No distractions
- Active recall, not recognition
- Say answer out loud (speaking practice)

**Dealing with Difficult Cards**
- Flag cards with repeated failures
- Rewrite for clarity
- Add mnemonic or image
- Break into smaller pieces

**Mature vs New Cards**
- Mature (interval > 21 days): Solid knowledge
- Young (interval < 21 days): Still learning
- Balance determines workload

**Dealing with Unknown Words**

*Step 1: Try to Understand Without Dictionary*
- Use context clues
- Look at root, prefix, suffix
- Cognates (similar to L1)
- Part of speech

*Step 2: Decide if Important*
- Is it repeated?
- Is it key to meaning?
- Is it high-frequency?

*Step 3: Look Up Strategically*
- Mark for later (first read-through)
- Look up during second read
- Add to SRS with sentence context

**Word Learning Approach**

*Example: Unknown word "serendipity"*
```
Context: "By serendipity, she found the perfect job while just browsing online."

Step 1: Infer meaning
- Found something good
- By chance or luck
- Unexpected positive outcome

Step 2: Verify
- Definition: "Finding something good without looking for it"

Step 3: Create SRS card
Front: By [...], she found the perfect job while browsing.
Back: serendipity (happy accident, fortuitous discovery)
```

### Word Learning Techniques

#### Contextual Learning

**Sentence Mining**
- Extract sentences from native materials
- One new word per sentence
- Context makes meaning clear
- Review sentence, not isolated word

*Example Process*
```
Source: Article about climate
Sentence: "Deforestation exacerbates climate change."
New word: exacerbates
Card front: Deforestation [...] climate change.
Card back: exacerbates (makes worse, intensifies)
```

**Collocation Learning**
- Learn words with their common partners
- More natural language use
- Easier to remember in combinations

```
Not just: "verb" = "conducir"
But: conducir un coche (drive a car)
     conducir con cuidado (drive carefully)
     permiso de conducir (driver's license)
```

#### Mnemonic Strategies

**Keyword Method**
1. Find similar-sounding word in L1
2. Create vivid mental image
3. Link image to meaning

```
Spanish: "lago" (lake)
Keyword: "log"
Image: A giant log floating in a lake
```

**Morphological Analysis**
- Break words into parts
- Learn common prefixes, roots, suffixes
- Decode new words independently

```
"Uncomfortable"
- un- (not) + comfort + -able (capable of)
- Not capable of providing comfort

"Prehistory"
- pre- (before) + history
- Before recorded history
```

**Visual Mnemonics**
- Draw pictures
- Associate with images
- Especially for concrete nouns

**Story Method**
- Connect multiple words in a story
- The more absurd, the better
- Review by retelling story

### Systematic Vocabulary Building
