# Pet Care Management Skill

Comprehensive patterns for health schedules, nutrition, training and behavior, daily routines, and record keeping for dogs and cats.

## Dog Care Fundamentals

### Health and Veterinary Care

#### Vaccination Schedules

**Puppy Vaccinations (First Year)**

*Core Vaccines (Essential for All Dogs)*
```
6-8 Weeks:
- DHPP #1 (Distemper, Hepatitis, Parainfluenza, Parvovirus)
- Bordetella (Kennel Cough) - optional but recommended

10-12 Weeks:
- DHPP #2 (booster)
- Leptospirosis #1
- Canine Influenza #1 (optional, risk-based)
- Lyme Disease #1 (optional, region-dependent)

14-16 Weeks:
- DHPP #3 (final puppy series)
- Leptospirosis #2 (booster)
- Canine Influenza #2 (if started)
- Lyme Disease #2 (if started)

16+ Weeks (as soon as legally allowed):
- Rabies (required by law)
```

**Adult Dog Vaccinations (Annual/Triennial)**
```
Annual Vaccines:
- Bordetella (if boarding, grooming, or dog parks)
- Canine Influenza (high-risk environments)
- Leptospirosis booster

Every 1-3 Years (check local laws and vet recommendation):
- DHPP booster (some states allow 3-year protocol)
- Rabies (1-year or 3-year depending on vaccine type and state law)

Every 1-2 Years:
- Lyme Disease booster (endemic areas)
```

**Titer Testing Alternative**
- Blood test measuring antibody levels
- Can replace some vaccines if immunity sufficient
- More expensive initially, may save long-term
- Not accepted for Rabies (legal requirement)
- Discuss with veterinarian

#### Preventative Medications

**Heartworm Prevention (Year-Round Recommended)**

*Monthly Oral Medications*
- Heartgard Plus (ivermectin): Heartworm + roundworm/hookworm
- Interceptor Plus (milbemycin): Heartworm + 5 intestinal parasites
- Simparica Trio: Heartworm + fleas/ticks + intestinal worms
- Trifexis: Heartworm + fleas + intestinal parasites

*Topical Medications*
- Revolution Plus: Heartworm + fleas + ticks + ear mites
- Advantage Multi: Heartworm + fleas + intestinal parasites

*Injectable (6-Month)*
- ProHeart 6 or 12: Administered by vet only

**Flea and Tick Prevention**

*Monthly Topical*
- Frontline Plus: Fleas + ticks
- Advantage II: Fleas only (fast-acting)
- K9 Advantix II: Fleas + ticks + mosquitoes (NOT safe for cats in household)

*Monthly Oral*
- Bravecto: Fleas + ticks (lasts 3 months)
- NexGard: Fleas + ticks
- Simparica: Fleas + ticks

*Collars*
- Seresto: Up to 8 months protection (fleas + ticks)

**Geographic Considerations**
- Tick-borne disease risk: Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis (Northeast, Upper Midwest, Pacific Coast)
- Heartworm prevalence: Higher in Southeast and Gulf Coast, but found everywhere
- Flea pressure: Year-round in warm climates, seasonal in cold

#### Regular Health Maintenance

**Annual Vet Exam (Minimum)**
- Physical examination
- Weight check and body condition score
- Dental evaluation
- Vaccination updates
- Heartworm test (annual, even if on prevention)
- Fecal test (check for intestinal parasites)
- Blood work (senior dogs 7+ years)

**Semi-Annual Exams for Seniors (7+ Years)**
- More frequent monitoring
- Early disease detection
- Blood panel: Kidney, liver, thyroid function
- Urinalysis
- Blood pressure
- Adjusted care plans

**At-Home Health Monitoring**

*Weekly Checks*
- Eyes: Clear, no discharge, redness, cloudiness
- Ears: Clean, no odor, redness, or head shaking
- Nose: Moist, no excessive discharge
- Coat: Shiny, no bald patches, excessive shedding, or parasites
- Skin: No redness, bumps, hot spots, or irritation
- Paws: Pads intact, nails appropriate length, no swelling
- Teeth: Check for tartar, redness, bad breath
- Weight: Monthly weighing, track trends

*Daily Observations*
- Appetite: Eating normally
- Thirst: Normal water intake (measure if concerned)
- Energy: Normal activity level
- Bathroom: Regular, normal consistency
- Behavior: No signs of pain, anxiety, or changes

**Emergency Warning Signs**
- Difficulty breathing or excessive panting
- Bloated abdomen (especially large breeds - GDV risk)
- Inability to urinate or defecate
- Seizures
- Collapse or extreme weakness
- Bleeding that won't stop
- Eye injury
- Suspected poisoning
- Heatstroke symptoms
- Severe vomiting or diarrhea (especially with blood)
- Unproductive retching (GDV emergency)

#### Dental Care

**Home Dental Care**

*Daily Brushing (Gold Standard)*
- Dog-specific toothpaste (never human toothpaste - xylitol toxic)
- Soft-bristle toothbrush or finger brush
- Focus on outer surfaces (tongue side less critical)
- Start slowly, build tolerance
- Reward and praise

*Dental Chews*
- VOHC (Veterinary Oral Health Council) approved products
- Greenies, OraVet, Whimzees
- Not replacement for brushing but helpful
- Size appropriate to prevent choking

*Water Additives*
- Products added to drinking water
- Help reduce plaque and tartar
- Less effective than mechanical cleaning
- Convenient addition

**Professional Dental Cleaning**
- Recommended every 1-3 years (varies by breed and individual)
- Requires anesthesia
- Complete cleaning above and below gumline
- X-rays to check for hidden problems
- Extractions if necessary
- Small breeds and certain breeds (Greyhounds, Yorkies) need more frequent cleanings

**Signs of Dental Problems**
- Bad breath
- Yellow or brown tartar
- Red, swollen gums
- Difficulty eating or dropping food
- Pawing at mouth
- Excessive drooling
- Loose or missing teeth

### Nutrition and Feeding

#### Life Stage Nutrition

**Puppy Nutrition (Birth to 1 Year, Large Breeds to 2 Years)**

*Nutritional Needs*
- Higher protein (minimum 22% dry matter)
- Higher fat (8% minimum)
- Appropriate calcium/phosphorus ratio (large breeds: careful not to over-supplement)
- DHA for brain and eye development
- Smaller, more frequent meals (3-4x daily young puppies, 2x daily by 6 months)

*Feeding Guidelines by Age*
```
8-12 weeks: 4 meals daily
3-6 months: 3 meals daily
6-12 months: 2 meals daily
12+ months: Transition to adult food, 2 meals daily
```

*Large Breed Puppy Considerations*
- Slower growth better for joint development
- Special large breed puppy formulas (controlled calcium)
- Don't overfeed (obesity risk)
- Keep lean during growth
- Continue large breed puppy food until 18-24 months

**Adult Dog Nutrition (1-7 Years)**

*Basic Requirements*
- Protein: 18% minimum (higher for active dogs)
- Fat: 5% minimum (higher for working dogs)
- Balanced vitamins and minerals
- AAFCO statement on label
- 2 meals daily (or 1 for some breeds)

*Activity Level Adjustments*
- Sedentary: Reduce calories by 10-20%
- Moderate activity: Standard portions
- Very active/working: Increase by 20-40%
- Performance formulas for working dogs

**Senior Dog Nutrition (7+ Years)**

*Nutritional Changes*
- May need fewer calories (reduced activity)
- Maintain protein to preserve muscle mass
- Joint support: Glucosamine, chondroitin, omega-3s
- Antioxidants for cognitive health
- Easily digestible ingredients
- May need softer food if dental issues

*Special Considerations*
- Weight management (obesity common in seniors)
- Kidney support formulas if needed
- More frequent, smaller meals if digestive issues
- Fresh water always available

#### Choosing Quality Dog Food

**Reading Labels**

*Ingredient List Order*
- First 5 ingredients most important (bulk of food)
- Named meat source first (chicken, beef, salmon - not "meat meal")
- Whole grains or quality carbs (sweet potato, brown rice)
- Avoid excessive fillers (corn gluten meal, wheat middlings)
- Preservatives: Natural better (tocopherols) vs chemical (BHA, BHT)

*AAFCO Statement*
- "Complete and balanced nutrition"
- Feeding trial vs formulation (trial is better validation)
- Appropriate life stage noted

*Guaranteed Analysis*
- Minimum protein and fat percentages
- Maximum fiber and moisture
- Compare on dry matter basis (remove moisture)

**Food Types**

*Dry Kibble*
- Most economical
- Long shelf life
- Dental benefits (mild)
- Complete nutrition
- Easy storage
- Variety of quality levels

*Canned/Wet Food*
- Higher moisture (good for hydration)
- More palatable
- More expensive per calorie
- Shorter shelf life once opened
- Softer for seniors or dental issues
- Can mix with kibble

*Raw Diet*
- Controversial
- Requires research and care
- Bacterial contamination risk
- Nutritional balance challenging
- Expensive
- Work with veterinary nutritionist if pursuing

*Home-Cooked*
- Complete control over ingredients
- Time-consuming
- Must be nutritionally balanced (veterinary nutritionist consultation)
- Risk of deficiencies if not done correctly

**Feeding Guidelines**

*Portion Control*
- Follow bag guidelines as starting point
- Adjust based on body condition
- Measure food (don't eyeball)
- Account for treats (10% of daily calories max)
- Monitor weight monthly

*Body Condition Score (1-9 Scale)*
- 1-3: Underweight (ribs, spine very visible)
- 4-5: Ideal (ribs palpable with slight fat cover, visible waist)
- 6-7: Overweight (difficult to feel ribs, no waist)
- 8-9: Obese (no ribs palpable, distended abdomen)

*Meal Schedule*
- Consistent times daily
- Puppies: Multiple meals
- Adults: 1-2 meals (2 preferred, reduces bloat risk)
- Food available 15-20 minutes, then remove
- Fresh water always available

#### Toxic Foods and Safety

**Common Toxic Foods**
- Chocolate (theobromine toxicity - darker chocolate more dangerous)
- Grapes and raisins (kidney failure)
- Onions and garlic (anemia - toxic in large amounts)
- Xylitol (artificial sweetener - severe hypoglycemia, liver failure)
- Macadamia nuts (weakness, tremors)
- Avocado (persin toxicity)
- Alcohol (ethanol toxicity)
- Caffeine (similar to chocolate)
- Raw yeast dough (expansion, alcohol production)
- Cooked bones (splintering risk)

**Moderately Safe (Small Amounts)**
- Peanut butter (xylitol-free only)
- Cheese (high fat, lactose - small amounts)
- Bread (plain, baked)
- Cooked eggs
- Cooked lean meats (no seasoning)

**Safe Treats**
- Carrots (low calorie, dental benefits)
- Apples (remove seeds - cyanide)
- Blueberries (antioxidants)
- Watermelon (seedless, no rind)
- Cooked sweet potato
- Green beans (plain)
- Plain popcorn (air-popped, no butter)

### Training and Behavior

#### Puppy Training Fundamentals

**Socialization Window (3-14 Weeks)**

*Puppy Classes*
- Start after second vaccination set
- Socialization with other puppies
- Basic training in distracting environment
- Professional guidance
- Worth the investment

**House Training**

*Crate Training Method*
- Crate is den, dogs don't soil den
- Size: Just big enough to stand, turn, lie down
- Schedule: Out every 1-2 hours initially
- After eating, drinking, playing, waking
- Praise and treat immediately after elimination outside
- Overnight: May need middle-of-night trip initially

*Schedule and Routine*

3. Say name + "come" enthusiastically
4. Reward generously when they come
5. NEVER punish when they come (even if took long)
6. Long line for practice outdoors
7. High-value treats

*Leave It*

```

**Adult Cat Vaccinations**

*Core Vaccines*
- FVRCP: Every 1-3 years (titer testing alternative)
- Rabies: 1-year or 3-year protocol (state law dependent)

*Non-Core (Risk-Based)*
- FeLV: Annual for cats with outdoor access or FeLV+ cats in home
- FIV: Controversial effectiveness, discuss with vet
- Bordetella: Shelter environments, catteries

**Indoor vs Outdoor Considerations**
- Indoor-only: Core vaccines still needed (rabies law, occasional escape risk)
- Outdoor access: All vaccines recommended
- Boarding/grooming: May require additional vaccines

#### Preventative Medications

**Flea and Tick Prevention**

*Monthly Topical*
- Revolution Plus: Fleas + ticks + heartworm + ear mites + intestinal worms

- Early detection crucial for management

**At-Home Health Monitoring**

*Weekly Checks*
- Eyes: Clear, no discharge, third eyelid not visible
- Ears: Clean, no odor, dark debris (ear mites)
- Nose: Clean, no discharge
- Coat: Grooming themselves (poor grooming = illness sign)
- Skin: No scabs, hair loss, parasites
- Weight: Monthly weighing (scale for small changes)
- Teeth: Check for tartar, redness, drooling
- Litter box: Monitor frequency and consistency

*Daily Observations*
- Eating: Appetite changes significant in cats
- Drinking: Increased thirst (diabetes, kidney disease)

### Nutrition and Feeding

#### Life Stage Nutrition

**Kitten Nutrition (Birth to 1 Year)**

*Nutritional Needs*
- Higher protein (minimum 30%)
- Higher fat (9% minimum)
- More calories per pound
- Small, frequent meals (3-4x daily young kittens)
- DHA for development
- Transition to 2x daily by 6 months

*Feeding Schedule by Age*
```
4-8 weeks: Free-feeding or 4-5 small meals (weaning)
2-3 months: 4 meals daily
3-6 months: 3 meals daily
6-12 months: 2 meals daily
12+ months: Transition to adult food
```

**Adult Cat Nutrition (1-7 Years)**

*Basic Requirements*
- Obligate carnivores (need meat protein)
- Protein: 26% minimum (higher better)
- Taurine essential (amino acid, only in meat)
- Fat: 9% minimum
- Low carbohydrate (natural diet very low carb)
- AAFCO statement on label

*Feeding Methods*
- Scheduled meals: 2x daily, measured portions
- Free-feeding: Less ideal (obesity risk), only if maintaining healthy weight
- Combination: Measured daily amount, available all day
- Puzzle feeders: Mental stimulation, slow eating

**Senior Cat Nutrition (7+ Years)**

*Nutritional Changes*
- May need fewer calories if less active
- Maintain high protein (muscle mass)
- Enhanced palatability (appetite often decreases)
- Easy to chew/digest
- Kidney support formulas if needed (common issue)
- More frequent, smaller meals

*Special Considerations*
- Chronic kidney disease (CKD) common - special diet
- Hyperthyroidism - special diet or medication
- Weight loss concerning (many possible causes)
- Ensure adequate water intake

#### Wet vs Dry Food

**Wet Food Advantages**
- High moisture (70-80%) - excellent for hydration
- Lower carbohydrate (more species-appropriate)
- More palatable
- Better for weight loss (high water, filling)
- Easier for cats with dental issues

**Wet Food Disadvantages**
- More expensive
- Spoils quickly (1-2 hours out)
- Less convenient
- Need to refrigerate opened cans

**Dry Food Advantages**
- Convenient and economical
- Long shelf life
- Can free-feed
- Dental benefits (minimal, marketing myth)

**Dry Food Disadvantages**
- Low moisture (10%)
- Higher carbohydrates
- Contributes to dehydration
- Calorie-dense (overeating risk)
- Less species-appropriate

**Optimal Approach**
- Wet food primary diet
- Small amount dry for convenience/enrichment
- Or all wet if possible
- Transition gradually (weeks)
- Fresh water always available

#### Choosing Quality Cat Food

**Reading Labels**

*Named Protein Sources*
- "Chicken," "salmon," "turkey" (specific)
- Avoid "meat," "poultry" (vague)
- First ingredients should be meat
- Multiple protein sources good

*Avoid Excessive Fillers*
- Corn, wheat, soy (not needed by cats)
- By-products (quality varies)
- Excessive carbohydrates

*AAFCO Statement*
- Complete and balanced
- Life stage appropriate
- Feeding trial preferred over formulation

**Grain-Free Controversy**
- No need for grains (carnivores)
- But grain-free often means high legumes
- DCM (heart disease) link in dogs, less clear in cats
- Choose based on overall quality, not just grain-free

**Toxic Foods for Cats**
- Onions and garlic (anemia)
- Chocolate (theobromine)
- Grapes and raisins (kidney issues)
- Xylitol (hypoglycemia, liver failure)
- Alcohol
- Caffeine
- Raw dough
- Milk/dairy (lactose intolerance common)
- Raw fish (thiamine deficiency)
- Bones (choking, obstruction)

**Safe Treats (Small Amounts)**
- Cooked chicken or turkey (plain)
- Cooked fish (occasional)
- Cat-specific treats (freeze-dried meat)
- Plain cooked egg

#### Water and Hydration

**Water Requirements**
- 3.5-4.5 oz per 5 lbs body weight daily
- Most from food if wet food fed
- Fresh water always available
- Dehydration common in cats

**Encouraging Water Intake**
- Multiple water sources throughout home
- Water fountains (cats prefer moving water)
- Wide, shallow bowls (whiskers don't touch sides)
- Clean daily
- Away from litter box
- Wet food increases hydration significantly

**Signs of Dehydration**
- Skin tent test (skin doesn't snap back)
- Dry gums
- Sunken eyes
- Lethargy
- Concentrated urine

- Make appropriate areas attractive (catnip, treats)

*Training*
- Redirect to post when starts on furniture
- Reward when uses appropriate scratcher
- Play near scratching posts
- Never punish (will scratch when you're gone, damages trust)

**Declawing Controversy**
- Amputates first bone of each toe
