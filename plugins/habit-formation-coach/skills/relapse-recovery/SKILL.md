# Relapse Recovery Skill

**Compassionate, evidence-based support for getting back on track after habit setbacks**

## Core Principles

1. **Zero Shame**: Setbacks are normal, expected, informative (not failure)
2. **Systemic Focus**: Problems are environmental/design issues (not character flaws)
3. **Fresh Start Framing**: Every moment is opportunity to begin again
4. **Obstacle Removal**: Fix the system, not the person
5. **Learning Orientation**: Setbacks provide valuable data for optimization

## The Science of Setbacks

### Setback Statistics (Normalize Failure)

**Research findings**:
- 88% of people fail at first habit attempt
- Average person restarts 4-7 times before establishment
- 92% of New Year's resolutions fail by February
- Setbacks are the NORM, not the exception

**Use these to normalize**:
- "You're in the 88% majority who experience setbacks"
- "Most successful habit builders restarted 4-7 times"
- "This is expected, not exceptional"

### Why Setbacks Happen

**Behavior Model breakdown** (B=MAP):
```
Setback occurs when: M‚Üì OR A‚Üì OR P‚Üì

Motivation dropped: Natural wave, external stress
Ability decreased: Life got harder, habit too big
Prompt failed: Routine disrupted, anchor broken
```

**Common root causes**:
1. **Habit too big**: Most common (60% of setbacks)
2. **Weak anchor**: Anchor doesn't happen reliably (25%)
3. **Life disruption**: Travel, illness, stress (10%)
4. **Wrong goal**: External motivation, not authentic (5%)

## Compassionate Response Framework

### Language Patterns

**Replace shame with curiosity**:

**‚ùå Shame-based**:
- "Why didn't you do it?"
- "You need more discipline"
- "You're not committed enough"
- "Stop making excuses"
- "Just try harder"

**‚úÖ Curiosity-based**:
- "What made it difficult?"
- "What obstacles got in the way?"
- "What can we adjust in the system?"
- "What did you learn?"
- "How can we make this easier?"

### Empathy Statements

**Validation first**:
- "This is frustrating, I understand"
- "Most people experience this"
- "Your feelings make sense"
- "Setbacks are part of the process"

**Then reframe**:
- "This isn't failure, it's feedback"
- "You learned something valuable"
- "Let's use this information"
- "Every restart is a chance to improve the design"

## Obstacle Analysis Methods

### The 5 Whys Technique

**Dig to root cause**:
```
"I missed my meditation habit"

Why? "I forgot"
Why? "Didn't see my cushion"
Why? "Put it in closet after guests"
Why? "Wanted to tidy up"
Why? "Guest disrupted routine"

Root cause: Environment changed (guests)
Solution: Keep cushion visible OR create visible backup cue
```

**Stop at environmental/systemic cause**:
- Don't go to "Because I'm undisciplined" (not actionable)
- Go to "Because the cue wasn't visible" (actionable)

### Obstacle Categories and Solutions

| Category | Example | Solution |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Environmental** | Tool not accessible | Move tool to anchor location |
| **Temporal** | Schedule changed | New anchor for new schedule |
| **Social** | Others interfering | Communicate boundary or adjust time |
| **Physiological** | Exhausted at habit time | Move to high-energy time or make smaller |
| **Cognitive** | Forgetting to do it | Strengthen cue, add visual reminder |
| **Systemic** | Travel, illness, stress | Accept pause OR create adaptive version |
| **Motivational** | "Should" not "want" | Reconnect to authentic aspiration |

### Pattern Recognition

**Single setback** (1-2 days):
- Likely random obstacle
- Simple fix usually works
- Environmental tweak needed

**Recurring pattern** (same obstacle repeatedly):
- Systemic issue
- Needs design change (not just reminders)
- Often habit too big or wrong anchor

**Complete breakdown** (7+ days, multiple attempts):
- Fundamental mismatch
- Wrong habit, wrong time, or wrong goal
- Consider: Different habit OR pause this one

## Recovery Protocols by Situation

### Short Break (2-3 Days)

**Assessment**:
- Previous success: [High/Medium]
- Obstacle: [Specific, identifiable]
- Severity: [Minor]

**Protocol**:
```markdown
1. Acknowledge success: "[X] days completed shows this CAN work"
2. Identify obstacle: "[Specific issue]"
3. Quick fix: "[Environmental adjustment]"
4. Fresh start: "Tomorrow at [anchor time]"
5. Monitor: "Check in daily for next 7 days"

Expected recovery: 1-2 days back to baseline
```

**Example**:
```
"3-day break after 12-day streak.

Your 12 days proved you CAN do this.
Obstacle: Travel disrupted morning routine
Fix: Create travel anchor ('After hotel room alarm')
Start: Tomorrow morning at hotel

You'll be back at 12 days in less than 2 weeks."
```

### Week+ Break (7-14 Days)

**Assessment**:
- Previous success: [Variable]
- Obstacle: [Multiple or persistent]
- Severity: [Moderate]

**Protocol**:
```markdown
1. No shame: "10 days is a longer break. Let's understand what happened."
2. Deep analysis: [Systematic review of obstacles]
3. Identify pattern: [What's consistently difficult?]
4. Redesign if needed: [Smaller, better anchor, different time]
5. Fresh start with adjustments: [Modified approach]
6. Support structure: [Daily check-ins, backup plans]
7. Lower bar initially: [70% target week 1, rebuild to 80%+]

Expected recovery: 2-3 weeks to re-establish
```

**Example**:
```
"10-day break suggests something systemic.

Pattern identified: Evening habit, but getting home late
Root cause: Anchor unreliable (arrival time varies)

Redesign:
- Old: "After I get home" (4-7pm range, unpredictable)
- New: "After I brush teeth before bed" (reliable, every day)
- Even smaller: 1 minute instead of 2 (rebuild confidence)

Fresh start: Tonight with new anchor
Week 1 goal: 5/7 days (rebuilding)
Week 2 goal: 6/7 days
Week 3+: Back to 80%+
```

### Repeated Pattern (3+ Restarts)

**Assessment**:
- Previous success: [Brief, never sustained]
- Obstacle: [Recurring theme]
- Severity: [Fundamental issue]

**Protocol**:
```markdown
1. Acknowledge pattern: "[N]th restart suggests design issue"
2. Honest assessment: "Is this the right habit right now?"
3. Options:
   a) Make MUCH smaller (10x reduction)
   b) Different anchor/timing
   c) Different but related habit
   d) Pause and revisit later
4. User choice: [Emphasize agency]
5. Support: [If continuing, intensive support]

No expectation of immediate success - exploration phase
```

**Example**:
```
"This is the 4th restart. Pattern: Works for 5-7 days, then stops.

Common theme: "Too tired" at 6pm

Honest conversation: Evening might not be your time.

Options:
1. Make MUCH smaller: 30 seconds (can't say 'too tired')
2. Move to morning: High energy, more reliable
3. Different habit: Maybe meditation isn't calling to you right now?
4. Pause entirely: Focus on other priorities

All of these are valid. What feels right to YOU?"
```

### Life Disruption (Illness, Major Event, Crisis)

**Assessment**:
- Cause: [External, unavoidable]
- Severity: [Temporary but significant]
- Recovery: [When life stabilizes]

**Protocol**:
```markdown
1. Normalize pause: "Of course habit paused during [event]"
2. Permission to rest: "Self-care comes first"
3. Options:
   a) Full pause until stability returns
   b) Adapted version for current context
   c) Different habit that fits current reality
4. No timeline pressure: "Resume when YOU'RE ready"
5. Maintain connection: [Optional minimal version]

Focus on survival and stability, not optimization
```

**Example**:
```
"Your parent's illness is a major life event. Of course
your meditation habit paused. This isn't a habit failure.
This is life happening.

Options:
1. Pause habit completely. Resume when life calms down.
   Your 21-day success is still real. It'll be there when ready.

2. Minimal version: 3 breaths (not 2 min) when you remember.
   Lower expectation to 2-3 days/week. Just maintain connection.

3. Different practice: Maybe 'Text one friend' fits better
   than meditation right now. Meets need for connection.

You choose. No wrong answer. Take care of yourself first. üíô"
```

## Redesign Strategies

### When to Redesign

**Indicators**:
- [ ] Completion rate consistently <60%
- [ ] Same obstacle recurring 3+ times
- [ ] Habit feels like burden (not pleasure)
- [ ] User expresses dread/avoidance
- [ ] Life circumstances changed permanently

### Redesign Options

**Option 1: Make it MUCH smaller**
```
Current: "Meditate 5 minutes"
Problem: Feels too long, skipping often
Redesign: "Take 3 deep breaths"

Why: Remove all objections. Can ALWAYS do 3 breaths.
```

**Option 2: Change anchor**
```
Current: "After I get home from work"
Problem: Arrival time varies, unreliable trigger
Redesign: "After I change into home clothes"

Why: Reliable anchor that happens regardless of timing.
```

**Option 3: Change timing entirely**
```
Current: Evening habit (but exhausted)
Problem: No energy at end of day
Redesign: Morning habit (high energy)

Why: Match habit to energy levels.
```

**Option 4: Different habit, same goal**
```
Current: "Run 2 miles" (want fitness)
Problem: Too much time, intimidating
Redesign: "Put on running shoes" (same aspiration)

Why: Lower barrier, builds toward same goal.
```

**Option 5: Pause this, try different approach**
```
Current: Solo meditation (want calm)
Problem: Doesn't resonate, feels forced
Redesign: "Walk outside for 5 min" (same aspiration)

Why: Different path to same destination.
```

## Fresh Start Framing

### The Power of "Day 1"

**Insight**: Any moment can be "Day 1" - don't wait.

**Don't wait for**:
- Monday
- Next month
- New Year
- "When I'm ready"
- "Perfect conditions"

**Start**:
- Right now
- Next anchor point
- Tomorrow morning
- Whenever you remember

**Reframe past**:
- "Previous attempts were practice"
- "You learned what doesn't work"
- "Each try strengthens the next"
- "This time armed with more information"

### Growth Mindset Language

**‚ùå Fixed mindset**:
- "I'm just not a morning person"
- "I can't stick to anything"
- "I always fail at habits"
- "This isn't working for me"

**‚úÖ Growth mindset**:
- "I haven't found my optimal time YET"
- "I'm learning what works for me"
- "Each attempt teaches me something"
- "This design needs adjustment"

---

## Support Structures

### Intensive Support Period

**After major setback** (7+ days missed):
```
Week 1: Daily check-ins
- Accountability-tracker every day
- Quick win focus (just show up)
- Celebrate any completion

Week 2-3: Every other day
- Build confidence
- Maintain attention without pressure

Week 4+: Return to normal
- Weekly analysis with behavior-analyst
- Independent tracking
```

### Backup Plans

**Create if-then plans for known obstacles**:
```
"If I'm traveling, then I'll [travel anchor]"
"If I'm sick, then I'll do [minimal version]"
"If I forget in morning, then I'll [do when remember]"
"If I'm stressed, then I'll [reduce to 30 seconds]"
```

### Social Support (Optional)

**Accountability buddy**:
- Share daily check-ins
- Celebrate together
- No judgment for misses
- Mutual support

**Habit community**:
- Join group doing same habit
- Share experiences
- Normalize struggles
- Learn from others

## Reframing Setbacks as Learning

### What Setbacks Teach

**Every setback reveals**:
- Which anchors are strong vs weak
- What obstacles exist in environment
- When energy/motivation is high vs low
- What size habit is actually sustainable
- Whether goal is authentic or external

**Use setbacks to**:
- Refine anchor choice
- Remove environmental obstacles
- Adjust timing to energy patterns
- Right-size the behavior
- Clarify true motivation

### The Scientific Mindset

**Treat habit building as experiment**:
```
Hypothesis: "After coffee ‚Üí 2 min meditation" will work
Test: Try for 21 days
Result: Worked 18/21 days, missed weekends
Learning: Need separate weekend anchor
Iteration: Add "After I check phone ‚Üí 2 min meditation" for weekends
Retest: Try revised approach
```

**No failure, only data**:
- Completion = data point (worked)
- Miss = data point (obstacle identified)
- All information is useful

---

## Recovery Metrics

### Success Indicators

**Recovery is succeeding when**:
- Completion rate returning to 70%+ (first week)
- User reports less dread, more ease
- Obstacles reduced or solved
- Fresh start feels genuine (not forced)
- Checking in without being prompted

**Warning signs recovery isn't working**:
- Still missing 50%+ after 2 weeks
- Same obstacles recurring
- Increasing avoidance/dread
- User expresses shame/defeat
- Defensive about tracking

---

## When to Recommend Pause

### Pause Indicators

**Suggest pausing when**:
- User clearly not ready (external pressure)
- Major life crisis (need stability first)
- Wrong habit (doesn't align with values)
- Repeated failures with all redesigns
- User expresses relief at idea of stopping

### How to Recommend Pause

**Frame positively**:
```
"It seems like this might not be the right habit right now.
And that's completely okay.

Options:
1. Pause this, revisit in 3 months when [life stabilizes]
2. Try different habit that fits current life better
3. Focus on other priorities - can't do everything

Pausing isn't quitting. It's being strategic about timing.
You can always come back to this when it's right."
```

**Preserve agency**:
- User decides (don't force)
- Present as valid option (not failure)
- Keep door open (can resume anytime)
