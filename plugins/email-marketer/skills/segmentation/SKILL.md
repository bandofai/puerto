## Segmentation Fundamentals

### Why Segment?

**Performance Lift from Segmentation**:
- 760% increase in revenue (DMA research)
- 50% higher open rates vs. non-segmented
- 100% higher click rates vs. non-segmented
- 3x higher conversion rates

### Segmentation Best Practices

**1. Start Simple, Add Complexity**
```
Level 1: Engaged vs. Inactive
Level 2: + Customer vs. Prospect
Level 3: + Product interest or purchase behavior
Level 4: + Lifecycle stage
Level 5: + RFM or predictive scores
```

**2. Ensure Actionability**

Every segment must have:
- **Clear definition**: Specific, measurable criteria
- **Sufficient size**: Minimum 100-500 members
- **Distinct behavior**: Different from other segments
- **Unique value**: Requires different messaging/offer
- **Data availability**: Can actually identify members

**3. Limit Active Segments**

Optimal: 5-10 active segments
Maximum: 15 segments
- More segments = harder to manage
- Diminishing returns beyond 10-12
- Focus on highest-impact segments

### Segmentation Criteria Hierarchy

**Primary Criteria** (Highest Impact):
1. Purchase behavior (RFM)
2. Lifecycle stage
3. Engagement level
4. Product/category interest

**Secondary Criteria**:
5. Demographics/Firmographics
6. Geographic location
7. Acquisition source
8. Predicted behaviors

## Segmentation Types

### 1. Demographic Segmentation (B2C)

**When to Use**:
- Product appeal varies by demographic
- Messaging tone should differ
- Offer relevance changes by life stage

**Key Variables**:
```
Age Groups:
- 18-24: Gen Z, students, early career
- 25-34: Millennials, young professionals, new parents
- 35-44: Mid-career, established families
- 45-54: Peak earning, teens/college kids
- 55+: Pre-retirement, empty nesters

Gender:
- Male, Female, Non-binary
- Use carefully, ensure relevance

Income Level:
- <$50K: Budget-conscious, value-focused
- $50K-$100K: Mid-market, balance of value and quality
- $100K-$150K: Premium segment
- $150K+: Luxury, high-end

Location:
- Urban vs. Suburban vs. Rural
- Geographic region
- Climate-based (seasonal products)
- Timezone (for send time optimization)
```

**Example Segments**:
```sql
-- Young Urban Professionals
SELECT * FROM subscribers
WHERE age BETWEEN 25 AND 35
  AND location_type = 'urban'
  AND income > 75000
  AND email_subscribed = true;

-- Budget-Conscious Families
SELECT * FROM subscribers
WHERE age BETWEEN 35 AND 45
  AND has_children = true
  AND income < 75000
  AND email_subscribed = true;
```

### 2. Firmographic Segmentation (B2B)

**When to Use**:
- B2B/SaaS businesses
- Solution needs vary by company size
- Different decision-makers by company type

**Key Variables**:
```
Company Size:
- 1-10: Solopreneur, micro-business
- 11-50: Small business
- 51-200: Mid-market
- 201-1000: Large business
- 1001+: Enterprise

Industry Vertical:
- Technology
- Healthcare
- Finance/Banking
- Retail/E-commerce
- Manufacturing
- Professional Services
- Education
- Non-profit

Revenue:
- <$1M: Startup
- $1M-$10M: Small business
- $10M-$50M: Mid-market
- $50M+: Enterprise

Job Role:
- C-Level (CEO, CTO, CFO): Strategic, ROI-focused
- VP/Director: Implementation, team impact
- Manager: Day-to-day operations, efficiency
- Individual Contributor: Hands-on usage
```

**Example Segments**:
```sql
-- Enterprise Decision Makers
SELECT * FROM subscribers
WHERE company_size > 1000
  AND job_title IN ('CEO', 'CTO', 'VP', 'Director')
  AND industry IN ('Technology', 'Finance', 'Healthcare')
  AND email_subscribed = true;

-- Small Business Power Users
SELECT * FROM subscribers
WHERE company_size BETWEEN 1 AND 50
  AND product_usage_level = 'high'
  AND email_subscribed = true;
```

### 3. Geographic Segmentation

**When to Use**:
- Localized offers or events
- Regional product availability
- Seasonal/climate considerations
- Time zone optimization

**Strategies**:
```
Country/Region:
- International vs. Domestic
- EU (GDPR considerations)
- North America, EMEA, APAC

State/Province:
- Tax implications (sales tax)
- Shipping costs and times
- Local events or regulations

City/Metro:
- Store locations nearby
- Local events and meetups
- Urban vs. rural offers

Timezone:
- Optimal send times
- Event scheduling
- Support hours alignment
```

## RFM Segmentation

**RFM = Recency, Frequency, Monetary**

The gold standard for e-commerce and transactional businesses.

### RFM Scoring

**Recency** (How recently did they purchase?)
```
Score 5: 0-30 days ago
Score 4: 31-60 days ago
Score 3: 61-90 days ago
Score 2: 91-180 days ago
Score 1: 180+ days ago
```

**Frequency** (How often do they purchase?)
```
Score 5: 10+ purchases
Score 4: 7-9 purchases
Score 3: 4-6 purchases
Score 2: 2-3 purchases
Score 1: 1 purchase
```

**Monetary** (How much do they spend?)
```
Score 5: Top 20% (e.g., $1000+)
Score 4: Next 20% (e.g., $500-$999)
Score 3: Next 20% (e.g., $250-$499)
Score 2: Next 20% (e.g., $100-$249)
Score 1: Bottom 20% (e.g., <$100)
```

### RFM Segments

| Segment | R | F | M | Description | Strategy |
|---------|---|---|---|-------------|----------|
| **Champions** | 5 | 5 | 5 | Best customers | VIP treatment, early access, advocacy program |
| **Loyal** | 4-5 | 4-5 | 4-5 | Consistent high-value | Reward loyalty, upsell premium |
| **Potential Loyalist** | 4-5 | 2-3 | 4-5 | Recent high spenders | Increase frequency, membership programs |
| **New Customers** | 5 | 1 | 2-4 | Recent first purchase | Onboarding, build relationship, second purchase |
| **Promising** | 3-4 | 2-3 | 2-3 | Average across all | Move up to loyal with targeted campaigns |
| **Need Attention** | 3 | 2-3 | 2-3 | Declining engagement | Re-engage with offers, feedback requests |
| **About to Sleep** | 2-3 | 1-2 | 1-2 | Declining, low value | Win-back campaigns, incentives |
| **At Risk** | 1-2 | 4-5 | 4-5 | Were good, now dormant | Urgent win-back, understand why churning |
| **Can't Lose** | 1 | 5 | 5 | Best customers going away | Aggressive retention, personal outreach |
| **Hibernating** | 1-2 | 1-2 | 1-3 | Long-time inactive | Re-activation or cleanup |
| **Lost** | 1 | 1 | 1 | Churned completely | Final win-back or suppress |

### RFM Implementation

```sql
-- Calculate RFM scores
WITH customer_rfm AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    email,
    -- Recency (days since last purchase)
    DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, MAX(purchase_date)) AS recency_days,
    CASE
      WHEN DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, MAX(purchase_date)) <= 30 THEN 5
      WHEN DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, MAX(purchase_date)) <= 60 THEN 4
      WHEN DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, MAX(purchase_date)) <= 90 THEN 3
      WHEN DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, MAX(purchase_date)) <= 180 THEN 2
      ELSE 1
    END AS recency_score,

    -- Frequency (number of purchases)
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS frequency_count,
    CASE
      WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) >= 10 THEN 5
      WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) >= 7 THEN 4
      WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) >= 4 THEN 3
      WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) >= 2 THEN 2
      ELSE 1
    END AS frequency_score,

    -- Monetary (total spend)
    SUM(order_total) AS monetary_total,
    NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(order_total)) AS monetary_score
  FROM orders
  WHERE customer_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY customer_id, email
)

-- Assign segment names
SELECT
  customer_id,
  email,
  recency_score,
  frequency_score,
  monetary_score,
  CONCAT(recency_score, frequency_score, monetary_score) AS rfm_score,
  CASE
    WHEN recency_score = 5 AND frequency_score = 5 AND monetary_score = 5 THEN 'Champions'
    WHEN recency_score >= 4 AND frequency_score >= 4 AND monetary_score >= 4 THEN 'Loyal'
    WHEN recency_score >= 4 AND frequency_score BETWEEN 2 AND 3 AND monetary_score >= 4 THEN 'Potential Loyalist'
    WHEN recency_score = 5 AND frequency_score = 1 THEN 'New Customers'
    WHEN recency_score BETWEEN 3 AND 4 AND frequency_score BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN 'Promising'
    WHEN recency_score = 3 AND frequency_score BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN 'Need Attention'
    WHEN recency_score = 2 AND frequency_score <= 2 THEN 'About to Sleep'
    WHEN recency_score BETWEEN 1 AND 2 AND frequency_score >= 4 THEN 'At Risk'
    WHEN recency_score = 1 AND frequency_score = 5 AND monetary_score = 5 THEN 'Cant Lose'
    WHEN recency_score BETWEEN 1 AND 2 AND frequency_score BETWEEN 1 AND 2 THEN 'Hibernating'
    ELSE 'Lost'
  END AS segment
FROM customer_rfm
ORDER BY recency_score DESC, frequency_score DESC, monetary_score DESC;
```

## Behavioral Segmentation

**Based on actions taken (or not taken)**

### Purchase Behavior

**Product Category Preference**:
```sql
-- Customers who primarily buy electronics
SELECT customer_id, email
FROM (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    email,
    category,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY purchase_count DESC) as rank
  FROM (
    SELECT
      o.customer_id,
      c.email,
      p.category,
      COUNT(*) as purchase_count
    FROM orders o
    JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
    WHERE o.purchase_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 6 MONTH)
    GROUP BY o.customer_id, c.email, p.category
  ) cat_counts
) ranked
WHERE rank = 1 AND category = 'Electronics';
```

**Cart Abandonment Segments**:
```sql
-- High-intent abandoners (cart > $100, added in last 24 hours)
SELECT
  customer_id,
  email,
  cart_value,
  cart_updated_at
FROM carts
WHERE cart_status = 'abandoned'
  AND cart_value > 100
  AND cart_updated_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
  AND email_subscribed = true;
```

**Browse Behavior**:
```sql
-- Browsed but never purchased specific category
SELECT DISTINCT
  v.visitor_id,
  v.email
FROM website_visits v
WHERE v.page_category = 'Premium Laptops'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = v.visitor_id
    AND o.product_category = 'Premium Laptops'
  )
  AND v.visit_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY);
```

### Engagement Behavior

**Email Engagement Tiers**:

**Highly Engaged**:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, email
FROM email_engagement
WHERE last_open_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY)
  AND open_rate_90d > 0.50
  AND click_rate_90d > 0.25;
```

**Moderately Engaged**:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, email
FROM email_engagement
WHERE last_open_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 60 DAY)
  AND open_rate_90d BETWEEN 0.20 AND 0.50
  AND click_rate_90d BETWEEN 0.10 AND 0.25;
```

**Low Engagement / At Risk**:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, email
FROM email_engagement
WHERE last_open_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 90 DAY)
  AND last_open_date < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 60 DAY)
  AND open_rate_90d < 0.20;
```

**Inactive**:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, email
FROM email_engagement
WHERE last_open_date < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 90 DAY)
  OR last_open_date IS NULL;
```

### Content Consumption

**Blog Readers**:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT visitor_id, email
FROM website_analytics
WHERE page_type = 'blog'
  AND visit_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY)
  AND visit_count >= 3;
```

**Video Watchers**:
```sql
SELECT user_id, email
FROM video_analytics
WHERE watch_percentage > 0.75
  AND video_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY);
```

**Resource Downloaders**:
```sql
SELECT user_id, email, resource_type
FROM downloads
WHERE download_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 90 DAY)
GROUP BY user_id, email, resource_type
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;
```

```sql
WITH user_lifecycle AS (
  SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.email,
    u.signup_date,
    u.subscription_status,
    l.last_login_date,
    DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, u.signup_date) AS days_since_signup,
    DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, l.last_login_date) AS days_since_activity,
    o.first_purchase_date,
    o.total_purchases,
    o.lifetime_value
  FROM users u
  LEFT JOIN logins l ON u.user_id = l.user_id
  LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.customer_id
)

SELECT
  user_id,
  email,
  CASE
    -- Trial Users
    WHEN subscription_status = 'trial' THEN 'Trial User'

    -- New Customers (first 90 days)
    WHEN first_purchase_date IS NOT NULL
      AND days_since_signup <= 90 THEN 'New Customer'

    -- Active Customers (90+ days, recently active)
    WHEN first_purchase_date IS NOT NULL
      AND days_since_signup > 90
      AND days_since_activity <= 30
      AND subscription_status = 'active' THEN 'Active Customer'

    -- At-Risk Customers (declining activity)
    WHEN first_purchase_date IS NOT NULL
      AND days_since_activity BETWEEN 31 AND 60
      AND subscription_status = 'active' THEN 'At-Risk Customer'

    -- Churned (cancelled or long inactive)
    WHEN subscription_status = 'cancelled'
      OR days_since_activity > 180 THEN 'Churned Customer'

    -- Prospects (never purchased)
    WHEN first_purchase_date IS NULL THEN 'Prospect'

    ELSE 'Unclassified'
  END AS lifecycle_stage
FROM user_lifecycle;
```

---

## Engagement-Based Segmentation

**Universal application across all business types**

### Email Engagement Scoring

**Engagement Score Calculation**:
```sql
SELECT
  subscriber_id,
  email,
  -- Weighted engagement score (0-100)
  (
    (opens_30d * 2) +
    (clicks_30d * 5) +
    (conversions_30d * 10) +
    (CASE WHEN last_open_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 7 DAY) THEN 20 ELSE 0 END)
  ) AS engagement_score,
  CASE
    WHEN engagement_score >= 50 THEN 'Highly Engaged'
    WHEN engagement_score >= 20 THEN 'Engaged'
    WHEN engagement_score >= 5 THEN 'Low Engagement'
    ELSE 'Inactive'
  END AS engagement_tier
FROM email_metrics
WHERE email_subscribed = true;
```

### Predictive Engagement Segments

**Likely to Engage**:
```sql
-- Historical high engagers who haven't engaged recently
SELECT s.subscriber_id, s.email
FROM subscribers s
JOIN email_engagement e ON s.subscriber_id = e.subscriber_id
WHERE e.lifetime_open_rate > 0.40
  AND e.lifetime_click_rate > 0.15
  AND e.last_open_date BETWEEN
    DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 45 DAY)
    AND DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 15 DAY);
```

**Re-engagement Candidates**:
```sql
-- Previously engaged, now declining
SELECT subscriber_id, email
FROM (
  SELECT
    subscriber_id,
    email,
    open_rate_90d,
    open_rate_30d,
    last_open_date
  FROM email_engagement
) e
WHERE open_rate_90d > 0.20
  AND open_rate_30d < 0.10
  AND last_open_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 60 DAY);
```

---

## Implementation Strategies

### Platform-Specific Implementation

**Email Service Provider Filters** (e.g., Mailchimp, HubSpot, Klaviyo):

```json
{
  "segment_name": "VIP Customers - High Engagement",
  "conditions": {
    "all": [
      {
        "field": "lifetime_value",
        "operator": "greater_than",
        "value": 1000
      },
      {
        "field": "last_purchase_date",
        "operator": "in_last",
        "value": "90_days"
      },
      {
        "field": "email_open_rate_90d",
        "operator": "greater_than",
        "value": 0.30
      },
      {
        "field": "total_purchases",
        "operator": "greater_than",
        "value": 5
      }
    ]
  },
  "actions": {
    "tag": "VIP",
    "send_time": "optimal_per_subscriber",
    "frequency": "weekly"
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Segments vs. Static Lists

**Dynamic Segments** (Recommended):
```
✅ Auto-update based on criteria
✅ Always current
✅ Less maintenance
✅ Consistent logic

Use for:
- Engagement tiers
- Lifecycle stages
- RFM segments
- Behavioral segments
```

**Static Lists**:
```
✅ Fixed membership
✅ Historical snapshots
✅ Campaign-specific

Use for:
- One-time campaigns
- A/B test control groups
- Specific event attendees
```

### Segment Hierarchy

**Recommended Structure**:
```
1. Lifecycle Stage (primary)
   ├── Engagement Level (secondary)
   │   ├── RFM Score (tertiary)
   │   │   └── Product Interest (quaternary)

Example:
Active Customer → Highly Engaged → Champion (RFM) → Electronics Buyer
```

## Personalization Mapping

### Segment-to-Content Mapping

| Segment | Subject Line | Email Tone | Offer Type | Send Frequency |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|----------------|
| Champions | Exclusive, VIP | Appreciative | Early access, premium | Weekly |
| Loyal | Benefit-focused | Friendly | Rewards, loyalty bonus | 2-3x/week |
| New Customers | Welcoming | Educational | Onboarding, discounts | Daily (first week) |
| At-Risk | Urgency, concern | Supportive | Win-back, discounts | 2x/week |
| Prospects | Educational | Professional | Free resources, trials | Weekly |
| Inactive | Re-engagement | Casual | Incentive to return | Monthly |

### Content Variation Examples

**Same Campaign, Different Segments**:

**Champions**:
```
Subject: First access to our Black Friday deals, {{first_name}}
Content: As one of our top customers, you get 48 hours early access...
CTA: Shop VIP Early Access
```

**Active Customers**:
```
Subject: Black Friday starts now - 30% off everything
Content: Our biggest sale of the year is here...
CTA: Shop the Sale
```

**At-Risk**:
```
Subject: We miss you + an extra 40% off for you
Content: It's been a while since your last order. We'd love to have you back...
CTA: Claim My Welcome Back Discount
```

**Prospects**:
```
Subject: Black Friday offer + free shipping on first order
Content: New here? Perfect timing. Get 30% off + free shipping on your first order...
CTA: Shop Your First Order
```

## Testing Segmentation Effectiveness

### Segment Performance Metrics

**For Each Segment, Track**:
```
- Segment size
- Open rate
- Click rate
- Conversion rate
- Revenue per email
- Unsubscribe rate
- Spam complaint rate
- List growth/decline rate
```

### Segment Value Analysis

```sql
-- Calculate segment value
SELECT
  segment_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT subscriber_id) AS segment_size,
  AVG(open_rate) AS avg_open_rate,
  AVG(click_rate) AS avg_click_rate,
  AVG(conversion_rate) AS avg_conversion_rate,
  SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue,
  SUM(revenue) / COUNT(DISTINCT subscriber_id) AS revenue_per_subscriber,
  SUM(revenue) / SUM(emails_sent) AS revenue_per_email
FROM segment_performance
WHERE campaign_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 90 DAY)
GROUP BY segment_name
ORDER BY revenue_per_subscriber DESC;
```

### A/B Testing Segmentation

**Test Segmentation Value**:
```
Control: Non-segmented campaign to entire list
Treatment: Segmented campaigns with personalized messaging

Measure:
- Overall engagement lift
- Conversion lift
- Revenue impact
- Efficiency (effort vs. return)
```

---

## Privacy and Compliance

### GDPR Considerations

**Lawful Basis for Segmentation**:
```
✅ Consent: Explicit opt-in for email marketing
✅ Legitimate Interest: Analyze behavior for better service
✅ Contract: Necessary for service delivery (transactional)

❌ Don't segment on protected characteristics without basis
❌ Don't use personal data for undisclosed purposes
```

**Transparency**:
- Disclose segmentation and personalization in privacy policy
- Allow users to opt out of personalization
- Provide access to data used for segmentation (data portability)

### Preference Centers

**Let Users Self-Segment**:
```
Email Frequency:
[ ] Daily
[ ] Weekly
[ ] Monthly

Content Interests:
[ ] Product updates
[ ] Educational content
[ ] Promotions and deals
[ ] Company news

Product Categories:
[ ] Electronics
[ ] Clothing
[ ] Home goods
[ ] Sports & Outdoors
```

### Effort vs. Impact Matrix

**High Impact, Low Effort** (Do First):
- Engaged vs. Inactive
- Customer vs. Prospect
- Lifecycle stage (basic)

**High Impact, High Effort** (Do Second):
