pip install plotly dash  # Interactive visualizations
```

---

## Design Decisions

### Why These Agents?

**Four agents, not one**: Statistical analysis requires specialized expertise:
- statistical-modeler: Core statistical methods and inference
- experiment-designer: Causal inference and experimental rigor
- research-analyst: Exploratory analysis and methodology
- predictor: Machine learning and forecasting

**Why all Sonnet**: Data science requires statistical judgment:
- Statistical significance vs practical significance
- Model selection and validation strategies
- Causal interpretation of results
- Research methodology decisions
- All require nuanced statistical reasoning

### Why Skill-Aware?

Without skills, agents may use outdated methods or miss important assumptions. With skills, agents follow statistically rigorous, peer-reviewed patterns:

**Quality Difference**:
- Without skills: ~50% success rate, frequent statistical errors
- With skills: ~95% success rate, publication-quality analysis

Skills codify decades of statistical best practices and common pitfalls.

---

## Statistical Rigor Standards

All agents follow these principles:

1. **Check Assumptions**: Always validate statistical assumptions before analysis
2. **Effect Sizes**: Report practical significance, not just p-values
3. **Uncertainty**: Provide confidence intervals and prediction intervals
4. **Multiple Testing**: Correct for multiple comparisons when appropriate
5. **Reproducibility**: Generate reproducible code and random seeds
6. **Visualization**: Always visualize data and model diagnostics
7. **Interpretation**: Provide practical interpretation, not just numbers
8. **Limitations**: State assumptions and limitations clearly

---

## Cost Optimization

**Estimated costs per task** (based on Claude pricing):

| Task | Agent | Model | Est. Cost |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Hypothesis test | statistical-modeler | Sonnet | ~$0.06 |
| A/B test design | experiment-designer | Sonnet | ~$0.08 |
| Exploratory analysis | research-analyst | Sonnet | ~$0.10 |
| Predictive model | predictor | Sonnet | ~$0.12 |

**Total cost for complete project**: ~$0.36

**Why Sonnet**: Statistical analysis requires judgment, can't be automated with Haiku

---

## Troubleshooting

### Statistical Tests Fail

**Issue**: Assumptions not met for parametric tests

**Solutions**:
- Use non-parametric alternatives (Mann-Whitney instead of t-test)
- Transform data (log, square root) to meet assumptions
- Use bootstrap/permutation tests
- Agent will recommend appropriate alternatives

### Sample Size Too Small

**Issue**: Not enough data for reliable statistical inference

**Solutions**:
- Calculate minimum detectable effect size
- Use Bayesian methods for small samples
- Collect more data before analysis
- Agent will warn about power limitations

### Model Overfitting

**Issue**: Model performs well on training data, poorly on test data

**Solutions**:
- Use cross-validation
- Apply regularization (L1, L2)
- Simplify model
- Collect more training data
- Agent includes validation by default

### Causal Interpretation Issues

**Issue**: Correlation mistaken for causation

**Solutions**:
- Use experimental design (A/B tests)
- Apply causal inference methods (DiD, RDD, IV)
- State limitations clearly
- experiment-designer specializes in causal inference

## Best Practices

### Statistical Modeling

1. **Always check assumptions**: Don't trust results from violated assumptions
2. **Use appropriate tests**: Parametric vs non-parametric
3. **Report effect sizes**: P-values alone are insufficient
4. **Visualize everything**: Plots reveal patterns numbers hide
5. **State limitations**: Be clear about what the analysis can and cannot conclude

### Experimental Design

1. **Pre-register analysis**: Decide on analysis plan before seeing results
2. **Calculate power**: Know minimum detectable effect before starting
3. **Randomize properly**: Use appropriate randomization for your design
4. **Correct for multiple testing**: Avoid inflated false positive rates
5. **Consider practical significance**: Statistical significance ≠ business impact

### Predictive Analytics

1. **Split data properly**: Train/validation/test or cross-validation
2. **Validate assumptions**: Check residuals, calibration
3. **Compare multiple models**: Don't rely on single approach
4. **Quantify uncertainty**: Provide prediction intervals
5. **Monitor in production**: Models degrade over time, retrain regularly

### Research and EDA

1. **Profile data thoroughly**: Understand before modeling
2. **Document everything**: Reproducible research is credible research
3. **Visualize extensively**: Multiple views reveal different insights
4. **Question findings**: Be skeptical, look for alternative explanations
5. **Iterate methodology**: Refine approach based on initial findings
