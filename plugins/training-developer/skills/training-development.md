# Training Development Skill

Comprehensive patterns for instructional design using ADDIE model, Bloom's taxonomy, adult learning principles, assessment design, and training materials creation.

## Instructional Design Fundamentals

### ADDIE Model

The ADDIE model is the foundational framework for systematic instructional design. Each phase informs and supports the others in an iterative process.

#### Analysis Phase

**Purpose**: Understand the training need, audience, and context before designing anything.

**Key Questions to Answer**

*Performance Gap Analysis*
- What is the current performance?
- What is the desired performance?
- What is the gap?
- Is training the solution, or is it a process/policy/motivation issue?
- What are the consequences of not addressing this gap?

*Audience Analysis*
- Who are the learners?
- What is their current knowledge/skill level?
- What is their educational background?
- What motivates them?
- What are their learning preferences?
- What are their technology capabilities?

*ROI Calculation*
```
ROI = (Benefits - Costs) / Costs × 100

Example:
Training costs: $50,000
Benefits (increased productivity valued): $150,000
ROI = ($150,000 - $50,000) / $50,000 × 100 = 200%

For every $1 spent, gained $2 in return.
```

*Importance*

## Adult Learning Principles

Adult learners differ from children in key ways. Understanding these differences leads to more effective training design.

### Andragogy vs Pedagogy

**Pedagogy** (Teaching Children)
- Teacher-directed
- Learning for future use
- Subject-centered
- External motivation
- Dependent learners

**Andragogy** (Teaching Adults) - Malcolm Knowles
- Self-directed
- Immediate application
- Problem-centered
- Internal motivation
- Autonomous learners

### Six Principles of Adult Learning (Knowles)

#### 1. Need to Know

**Principle**: Adults need to know why they need to learn something before investing time and effort.

**Implications for Training**
- Start with clear objectives and outcomes
- Explain WIIFM (What's In It For Me)
- Connect to job performance and goals
- Show consequences of not learning
- Be transparent about purpose

**Application**
- Opening section: "By the end of this training, you will be able to..."
- "You need this skill because..."
- "This will help you..." (career, efficiency, quality, safety)
- Real-world examples of application

#### 2. Learner's Self-Concept

**Principle**: Adults have a self-concept of being responsible for their own decisions and want to be treated as capable.

**Implications for Training**
- Respect experience and expertise
- Minimize lecturing; maximize discussion and participation
- Allow choices when possible
- Avoid condescension
- Self-directed learning opportunities

**Application**
- "What has been your experience with...?"
- Options for activities or practice
- "How would you approach this in your role?"
- Peer learning and knowledge sharing
- Optional advanced modules or resources

#### 3. Role of Experience

**Principle**: Adults have accumulated experience that is a rich resource for learning.

**Implications for Training**
- Use experience as foundation
- Facilitate sharing of experience
- Connect new learning to prior knowledge
- Acknowledge diverse experiences
- Beware: Experience can also be source of bias or outdated practices

**Application**
- "Think about a time when..."
- Share experiences with partner or group
- Case studies relevant to their work
- Problem-based learning drawing on experience
- Respectfully challenge outdated practices

#### 4. Readiness to Learn

**Principle**: Adults are ready to learn things they need to know to cope with real-life situations.

**Implications for Training**
- Timing is important (just-in-time learning)
- Real-world relevance essential
- Link to current challenges or changes
- Avoid "nice to know" content
- Focus on immediate applicability

**Application**
- Training triggered by job change, new system, or problem
- "You'll use this tomorrow when..."
- Scenarios based on actual work situations
- Pull-learning approach (learner seeks training) vs push

#### 5. Orientation to Learning

**Principle**: Adults are problem-centered rather than subject-centered.

**Implications for Training**
- Organize around problems, not topics
- Use real scenarios and case studies
- Practical application over theory
- "How to" focus
- Task-oriented

**Application**
- Module titles: "How to Handle Difficult Customers" vs "Customer Service Theory"
- Start with problem, then provide knowledge/skills to solve
- Case-based learning
- Problem-based learning
- Simulation and practice with realistic scenarios

#### 6. Motivation to Learn

**Principle**: Adults are more motivated by internal factors (job satisfaction, quality of life, self-esteem) than external factors (grades, compliance).

**Implications for Training**
- Emphasize benefits, not just requirements
- Connect to personal and professional goals
- Create relevant and meaningful learning
- Remove barriers to learning (time, access, relevance)
- Recognize that compliance alone is weak motivator

**Application**
- "This will help you be more efficient/successful/confident"
- Link to career development
- Recognize and celebrate learning
- Make it enjoyable and engaging
- Address concerns and barriers

### Additional Adult Learning Considerations

#### Experiential Learning (Kolb)

**Four-Stage Cycle**
1. **Concrete Experience**: Do something, have an experience
2. **Reflective Observation**: Reflect on the experience
3. **Abstract Conceptualization**: Conclude or learn from reflection
4. **Active Experimentation**: Plan or try out what learned

**Training Application**
1. Activity, simulation, or scenario (experience)
2. Debrief: "What happened? How did you feel?" (reflect)
3. Discuss principles and takeaways (conceptualize)
4. Action planning: "How will you use this?" (experiment)

#### Learning Styles

**Note**: Learning styles theory (VARK, etc.) has limited scientific support, but learners do have preferences.

**Design Implication**: Use multimodal approach
- Visual: Graphics, diagrams, videos, demonstrations
- Auditory: Discussions, explanations, audio
- Reading/Writing: Text, handouts, notes
- Kinesthetic: Hands-on, practice, movement

**Best Practice**: Vary instructional methods to engage all learners

#### Barriers to Adult Learning

**Situational**
- Time constraints (busy schedules)
- Cost (training fees, time away from work)
- Childcare or eldercare responsibilities
- Transportation or location

**Institutional**
- Scheduling conflicts
- Prerequisites or requirements
- Lack of courses offered
- Technology barriers

**Dispositional**
- Fear of failure or looking foolish
- Low confidence in ability to learn
- Past negative school experiences
- Belief that "too old to learn"
- Resistance to change

**Addressing Barriers**
- Flexible scheduling and formats
- Supportive, non-judgmental environment
- Relevant, practical content
- Build confidence with early success
- Acknowledge and address concerns

## Assessment Design

Effective assessment measures whether learners achieved objectives and provides actionable feedback.

*Example 1: Aligned*
- Objective: "Apply the 5-step troubleshooting process to diagnose equipment failures."
- Assessment: Simulation or scenario where learner troubleshoots problem, observed with checklist

*Example 2: Misaligned*
- Objective: "Apply the 5-step troubleshooting process..."
- Assessment: Multiple choice test asking to identify the 5 steps (only Remember level)
- **Problem**: Test doesn't match objective; assessing knowledge, not application

**Alignment Checklist**
- Verb in objective matches assessment task
- Bloom's level of objective matches assessment level
- Conditions in objective present in assessment
- Degree/standard of performance clear in assessment

### Question Types and When to Use

#### Multiple Choice

**Strengths**
- Efficient to administer and score
- Objective scoring (no subjectivity)
- Can test large amount of content
- Good for knowledge and comprehension

**Limitations**
- Difficult to write good questions (art and science)
- Can encourage guessing
- Not suitable for higher-order thinking
- Can assess recognition, not always recall

**Best Practices**
- Clear, unambiguous question stem
- All options plausible
- Avoid "all of the above" and "none of the above"
- Avoid negative phrasing when possible
- Options similar length and structure
- Randomize correct answer position

**Example**
```
Which of the following is the first step in the conflict resolution model?

A) Propose solutions
B) Identify the problem
C) Evaluate outcomes
D) Implement the solution

Correct: B
```

#### True/False

**Strengths**
- Quick to answer and score
- Good for testing facts
- Useful as formative checks

**Limitations**
- 50% guess rate
- Limited information on understanding
- Tends to assess low levels only
- Can be ambiguous

**Best Practices**
- Clearly true or clearly false (avoid debatable)
- Avoid absolutes ("always," "never") unless truly absolute
- Keep statements concise
- More effective in sets than alone

**Example**
```
True or False: The ADDIE model must always be followed in linear order.

Answer: False (it's iterative)
```

#### Matching

**Strengths**
- Efficient for associations
- Compact format
- Good for terminology, concepts, examples

**Limitations**
- Limited to simple associations
- Low cognitive level
- Process of elimination aids guessing

**Best Practices**
- Unequal number of options (more options than stems, reduces guessing)
- Homogeneous content (all terms, all dates, etc.)
- Clear instructions
- Keep list relatively short (6-10 items)

**Example**
```
Match each stage of the ADDIE model to its primary purpose:

1. Analysis      A. Create materials
2. Design        B. Deliver training
3. Development   C. Assess needs
4. Implementation D. Measure effectiveness
5. Evaluation    E. Plan learning objectives
                 F. Write content

Answers: 1-C, 2-E, 3-A, 4-B, 5-D
```

#### Short Answer / Fill-in-the-Blank

**Strengths**
- Requires recall, not just recognition
- Reduces guessing
- Quick to answer
- Good for key terms or facts

**Limitations**
- Scoring can be subjective (acceptable variations)
- Time-consuming to score
- Difficult for ESL learners
- Usually low cognitive level

**Best Practices**
- One blank per item (not multiple in one sentence)
- Make answer clear and specific
- Avoid ambiguity
- Determine acceptable alternative answers in advance

**Example**
```
The _________ model is a systematic instructional design framework with five phases.

Answer: ADDIE (also accept: addie, Addie)
```

#### Essay / Constructed Response

**Strengths**
- Assesses higher-order thinking
- Allows for complex, nuanced responses

- Writing ability may confound assessment
- Fewer items can be included

**Best Practices**
- Clear, specific prompt
- Define expected length
- Provide rubric
- Use when higher-order thinking needed
- Train scorers for consistency

**Example**
```
Compare and contrast the Analysis and Evaluation phases of the ADDIE model. In your response, address the purpose of each phase, when each occurs, and the types of data collected. (150-200 words)

Rubric:
- Purpose of each phase clearly stated (2 points)
- Timing accurately described (2 points)
- Data types identified (2 points)
