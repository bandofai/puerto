```

## Cost Projection Models

### Basic Projection
```
Monthly projection = (Daily average kWh × 30) × Rate per kWh
Annual projection = Monthly projection × 12
```

### Seasonal Adjustment
```
Summer months (June-Aug): +30-40% for cooling
Winter months (Dec-Feb): +20-30% for heating (electric heat)
Spring/Fall (Mar-May, Sep-Nov): -10-20% moderate
```

### Time-of-Use (TOU) Calculation
```
Cost = (Peak kWh × Peak rate) + (Off-peak kWh × Off-peak rate) + (Mid-peak kWh × Mid-peak rate)
```

### Tiered Pricing
```
Tier 1: First X kWh at base rate
Tier 2: Next Y kWh at higher rate
Tier 3: Remaining at highest rate
Total = Sum of all tier costs
```

## Appliance Consumption Estimates

### Typical Annual Consumption (kWh)

**Major Appliances**:
- Central AC: 3,000-5,000 kWh
- Electric heat: 5,000-10,000 kWh
- Water heater (tank): 3,000-4,500 kWh
- Refrigerator: 400-600 kWh
- Washer & Dryer: 800-1,200 kWh
- Dishwasher: 300-500 kWh
- Electric oven/stove: 500-800 kWh

**Electronics & Lighting**:

- TV + entertainment: 200-400 kWh
- Computer + office: 200-400 kWh
- Phantom loads: 300-500 kWh

### Calculation Method

1. **Measure baseline**: Overnight minimum = always-on load
2. **Identify spikes**: Match timing to appliance use
3. **Calculate incremental**: Spike - baseline = appliance draw
4. **Multiply by duration**: kW × hours = kWh per use
5. **Extrapolate**: Uses per day × 365 = annual
