## Deployment Strategy

**Strategy Selected**: ‚úÖ Canary Deployment (Recommended)

**Rationale**: Canary deployment allows gradual rollout with monitoring at each phase. If issues arise, blast radius is minimized and rollback is quick.

**Alternative Strategies Considered**:
- Blue-Green: More complex, not needed for this hot-fix
- Rolling: Slower, less control over traffic percentage
- Immediate Full: Too risky for production hot-fix

---

## Phased Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Canary (10% Traffic)

**Objective**: Validate fix works with minimal risk

**Actions**:
```bash
# Deploy to canary servers (10% of traffic)
./deploy.sh --environment production --canary 10%

# OR using feature flag
feature-flags set hotfix-payment-null-check --percentage 10
```

**Duration**: 10 minutes minimum

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Error rate ‚â§ baseline (0.3%)
- ‚úÖ No new errors introduced
- ‚úÖ Response time within 110% of baseline (‚â§ 275ms)
- ‚úÖ Bug-specific metric improved (payment success rate up)

**Monitoring Checklist**:
- [ ] Error rate: [___% vs 0.3% baseline]
- [ ] Response time p95: [___ms vs 250ms baseline]
- [ ] Payment success rate: [___% vs 99.5% baseline]
- [ ] NullPointerException count: [0 expected]
- [ ] Request volume stable: [___/min vs 1000/min]

**Decision Point**:
- ‚úÖ **If Success**: Proceed to Phase 2 after 10 minutes
- ‚ùå **If Failure**: ROLLBACK immediately (see Section 6)

### Phase 2: Partial (50% Traffic)

**Objective**: Confirm stability at larger scale

**Actions**:
```bash
# Expand to 50% of traffic
./deploy.sh --environment production --percentage 50

# OR using feature flag
feature-flags set hotfix-payment-null-check --percentage 50
```

**Duration**: 10 minutes minimum

**Success Criteria**: Same as Phase 1

**Monitoring Checklist**:
- [ ] Error rate: [___% - stable or improving]
- [ ] Response time p95: [___ms - no degradation]
- [ ] Payment success rate: [___% - maintained or improved]
- [ ] System resources normal: CPU, memory, disk
- [ ] No anomalies in logs

**Decision Point**:
- ‚úÖ **If Success**: Proceed to Phase 3 after 10 minutes
- ‚ùå **If Failure**: ROLLBACK immediately (see Section 6)

### Phase 3: Full Deployment (100% Traffic)

**Objective**: Complete rollout to all users

**Actions**:
```bash
# Deploy to all servers
./deploy.sh --environment production --percentage 100

# OR using feature flag
feature-flags set hotfix-payment-null-check --percentage 100
```

**Duration**: 30 minutes minimum monitoring

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Error rate at or below baseline
- ‚úÖ No regressions detected
- ‚úÖ Performance within acceptable range
- ‚úÖ System stable under full load
- ‚úÖ User reports positive (no new complaints)

**Monitoring Checklist**:
- [ ] Error rate: [___% - at baseline]
- [ ] Response time p95: [___ms - normal]
- [ ] Payment success rate: [___% - improved]
- [ ] Support ticket volume: [stable/decreasing]
- [ ] Social media mentions: [no new complaints]
- [ ] Database connection pool: [normal]
- [ ] CPU/memory usage: [normal]

**Final Validation**:
- [ ] Original bug confirmed resolved
- [ ] No new issues introduced
- [ ] All metrics stable for 30 minutes
- [ ] Incident can be closed

## Monitoring Plan

### Real-Time Metrics

Monitor **every 1-2 minutes** during deployment:

| Metric | Baseline | Alert Threshold | Rollback Threshold |
|--------|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Error Rate | 0.3% | > 2% | > 5% |
| Response Time (p95) | 250ms | > 300ms | > 500ms |
| Payment Success Rate | 99.5% | < 99% | < 98% |
| Request Volume | 1000/min | < 800/min | < 600/min |
| NullPointerException | ~0 | > 5/min | > 10/min |

### Monitoring Commands

**Real-Time Logs**:
```bash
# Watch for errors
tail -f /var/log/payment-service/production.log | grep ERROR

# Watch for the specific bug
tail -f /var/log/payment-service/production.log | grep "paymentMethod.*null"

# Watch for success indicators
tail -f /var/log/payment-service/production.log | grep "payment.*success"
```

**Metrics Dashboard**:
- Primary: [https://dashboard.example.com/payment-service]
- Backup: [https://grafana.example.com/d/payment]

**Comparison Table** (fill in during deployment):

| Metric | Baseline | Phase 1 (10%) | Phase 2 (50%) | Phase 3 (100%) |
|--------|----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Error Rate | 0.3% | ___% | ___% | ___% |
| Response p95 | 250ms | ___ms | ___ms | ___ms |
| Payment Success | 99.5% | ___% | ___% | ___% |

## Rollback Procedure

### When to Rollback

**IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK if ANY of these occur**:
- ‚ùå Error rate > 5%
- ‚ùå Response time > 2x baseline (> 500ms)
- ‚ùå New critical errors appear
- ‚ùå Payment success rate drops below 98%
- ‚ùå User reports indicate issue worsening
- ‚ùå Any uncertainty about system stability

**"When in doubt, roll back"** ‚Äì Always better safe than sorry

### Rollback Commands

**Method 1: Git Revert** (if deployed via CI/CD)
```bash
# Revert the hot-fix commit
git revert abc123def456

# Push revert
git push origin main

# Deploy previous version
./deploy.sh production --version 2.3.0
```

**Method 2: Feature Flag** (fastest - instant rollback)
```bash
# Disable hot-fix immediately
feature-flags set hotfix-payment-null-check --percentage 0

# All traffic now uses old code path
```

**Method 3: Redeploy Previous Version**
```bash
# Deploy specific previous version
./deploy.sh production --version 2.3.0 --force
```

**Method 4: Blue-Green Switch** (if applicable)
```bash
# Switch traffic back to blue environment
./switch-traffic.sh --to blue
```

### Rollback Workflow

1. **Announce**: Post in incident channel: "üö® ROLLBACK INITIATED"
2. **Execute**: Run rollback command (choose fastest method)
3. **Monitor**: Watch metrics return to baseline (2-5 minutes)
4. **Verify**: Confirm system stability
5. **Communicate**: Update status page and stakeholders
6. **Investigate**: Why did hot-fix fail? Update and retry

**Estimated Rollback Time**: 2-3 minutes

**Post-Rollback Actions**:
- [ ] Verify error rate returns to baseline
- [ ] Confirm system stability
- [ ] Update incident channel and status page
- [ ] Schedule review: Why did hot-fix fail?
- [ ] Plan updated hot-fix if needed

- [ ] Review error logs for any new anomalies
- [ ] Check user feedback and support tickets
- [ ] Verify fix persists under varying load
- [ ] Document any observations

### Follow-up (Next Day)
- [ ] Schedule post-incident review (RCA)
- [ ] Confirm no delayed issues overnight
- [ ] Review metrics for full 24-hour period
- [ ] Close incident ticket
- [ ] Update runbooks if applicable
- [ ] Create tickets for permanent fix (if hot-fix is temporary workaround)

## Risk Assessment

### Known Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| New edge case not covered in testing | Low | Medium | Canary deployment catches early, quick rollback |
| Performance degradation under load | Low | Medium | Load testing completed, monitoring response time |
| Backwards compatibility issue | Very Low | High | Tested with legacy data, rollback ready |
| Deployment infrastructure failure | Very Low | Low | Tested deployment process, backup method available |

### Contingency Plans

**If canary deployment fails**:
- Rollback immediately
- Investigate why hot-fix failed
- Update fix and retest
- Retry deployment

**If monitoring unavailable**:
- Use backup dashboard: [link]
- Manual log tailing
- Delay deployment until monitoring restored (if P1/P2)

**If communication channels down**:
- Use backup channel: [#backup-channel]
- Email notification list: [list]
- Status page still primary
