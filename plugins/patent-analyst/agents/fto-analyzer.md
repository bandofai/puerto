    cat plugins/patent-analyst/skills/freedom-to-operate.md
elif [ -f ~/.claude/skills/freedom-to-operate/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat ~/.claude/skills/freedom-to-operate/SKILL.md
elif [ -f .claude/skills/freedom-to-operate/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat .claude/skills/freedom-to-operate/SKILL.md
fi
```

for PATENT in [high-risk patents]; do
    cat > ./patent-research/fto/validity-analysis/${PATENT}-validity.md <<EOF
# Validity Analysis: ${PATENT}

## Prior Art Search for Validity Challenge

### Search Strategy
**Objective**: Find prior art that anticipates or renders obvious the claimed invention

**Approach**:
1. Review cited references in patent
2. Search for earlier patents in same technology area
3. Search for non-patent literature (papers, standards, products)
4. Check patent family for admissions

### Prior Art Identified

#### Prior Art Reference 1: [Reference]
**Type**: Patent/Publication/Product
**Date**: [Date] (before priority date of [Patent Date]? Yes/No)
**Relevance**: [How it relates to claims]

**Anticipation Analysis** (35 USC 102):
Does this single reference disclose all claim elements?
- Element 1: Disclosed / Not Disclosed - [Explanation]
- Element 2: Disclosed / Not Disclosed - [Explanation]
- Element 3: Disclosed / Not Disclosed - [Explanation]

**Anticipation Conclusion**: Anticipates / Does Not Anticipate

**Obviousness Analysis** (35 USC 103):
If combined with other references, would claims be obvious?
- What does this reference teach?
- What's missing from this reference?
- Would combination be obvious to POSITA?
- Any teaching away from combination?

[Repeat for other prior art references]

### Obviousness Combination Analysis

**Proposed Combination**: [Reference A] + [Reference B]

**Reference A teaches**: [Elements X, Y]
**Reference B teaches**: [Element Z]
**Together cover**: All claim elements

**Motivation to Combine**:
[Would POSITA be motivated to combine these references?]

**KSR Factors**:
- Obvious to try? Yes/No
- Predictable results? Yes/No
- Simple substitution? Yes/No
- Teaching, suggestion, or motivation? Yes/No

**Obviousness Conclusion**: Likely Obvious / Possibly Obvious / Not Obvious

## Section 112 Analysis

### Indefiniteness (35 USC 112(b))
**Issue**: [Any unclear claim language?]
**Analysis**: [Would POSITA understand claim scope with reasonable certainty?]
**Conclusion**: Indefinite / Not Indefinite

### Written Description (35 USC 112(a))
**Issue**: [Does specification show possession of claimed invention?]
**Analysis**: [Especially for amended claims]
**Conclusion**: Adequate / Potentially Inadequate

### Enablement (35 USC 112(a))
**Issue**: [Can POSITA make and use invention without undue experimentation?]
**Analysis**: [Scope of claims vs. disclosure breadth]
**Conclusion**: Enabled / Potentially Not Enabled

## Prosecution History Review

**Key Amendments**:
[Any claim amendments that narrowed scope?]

**Arguments Made**:
[Any arguments that limit claim scope?]

**Cited Art Overcome**:
[How did applicant distinguish prior art?]

**Potential Prosecution History Estoppel**:
[Any subject matter surrendered?]

## Overall Validity Assessment

**Strength Rating**: Strong / Medium / Weak

**Strongest Invalidity Ground**:
[103 obviousness over [References X+Y] / 102 anticipation by [Reference Z] / 112 indefiniteness]

**Likelihood of Success**: High / Medium / Low

**Estimated Cost**:
- IPR filing: \$300K-500K
- District court invalidity defense: \$1M-3M

**Recommendation**:
[Pursue invalidity challenge / Use as leverage in licensing / Not worth challenging]
