# Patent Landscape Skill

Comprehensive patterns for technology landscape analysis, competitor intelligence, white space identification, and patent trend analysis.

## What is Patent Landscape Analysis?

**Definition**: A patent landscape (or patent mapping) is a comprehensive analysis of patent activity in a specific technology area, revealing trends, key players, technology evolution, and strategic opportunities.

**Key Objectives**:
1. Understand state of the art in technology area
2. Identify key competitors and their strategies
3. Find white space for innovation
4. Track technology trends and evolution
5. Support R&D and business strategy decisions
6. Identify potential acquisition targets or partners

## Landscape Analysis Methodology

### Phase 1: Define Scope

**Technology Scope**:
```json
{
  "technologyArea": "Electric vehicle battery technology",
  "subdomains": [
    "Lithium-ion batteries",
    "Solid-state batteries",
    "Battery management systems",
    "Thermal management",
    "Fast charging"
  ],
  "timePeriod": "2015-2024",
  "geographicScope": ["Global", "US", "EU", "China", "Japan", "Korea"],
  "excludedAreas": ["Hydrogen fuel cells", "Supercapacitors"],
  "businessObjective": "Identify white space for R&D investment"
}
```

**Key Questions to Answer**:
- Who are the dominant patent holders?
- What technologies are most active?
- Where is innovation concentrated geographically?
- What are the technology trends over time?
- What collaborations exist between entities?
- Where are the white space opportunities?

### Phase 2: Data Collection

**Search Strategy**:

**1. Classification-Based Search**:
```
Primary CPC: H01M 10/05 (Solid-state batteries)
Secondary CPC: H01M 10/42 (Methods for manufacturing)
Tertiary CPC: H02J 7/00 (Battery charging systems)
```

**2. Keyword-Based Search**:
```
("solid state" OR "solid-state") AND (battery OR batteries)
("lithium" OR "Li-ion") AND ("energy density" OR "power density")
("battery management" OR "BMS") AND ("electric vehicle" OR "EV")
```

**3. Hybrid Approach**:
```
(CPC=(H01M10/05 OR H01M10/42)) AND
("solid state battery" OR "solid electrolyte") AND
APD>=20150101 AND APD<=20241231
```

**Data Fields to Collect**:
- Patent number
- Title
- Assignee (company/institution)
- Inventors
- Filing date
- Publication date
- Priority date
- Grant date (if granted)
- Legal status
- Jurisdiction
- CPC/IPC classifications
- Abstract
- Claims count
- Citations (forward/backward)
- Patent family size

### Phase 3: Data Cleaning

**Standardization**:

**Assignee Name Normalization**:
```
"International Business Machines Corp" →
"International Business Machines Corporation" →
"IBM Corp" →
"IBM"
→ Standardized: "IBM"

"Samsung Electronics Co Ltd" →
"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd." →
"Samsung Electronics"
→ Standardized: "Samsung Electronics"
```

**Geographic Assignment**:
```
Priority country: First filing location
Assignee country: Company headquarters
Market coverage: Where patents filed (patent families)
```

**Classification Refinement**:
- Group patents by technical category
- Identify primary technology focus
- Handle multi-class patents appropriately

### Phase 4: Data Analysis

**Quantitative Analysis**:

**1. Patent Activity Over Time**:
```python
# Patent filing trends
patents_by_year = data.groupby('filing_year').count()

# Growth rate calculation
growth_rate = (current_year - previous_year) / previous_year * 100

# Technology lifecycle stage
if growth_rate > 20%:
    stage = "Emerging"
elif growth_rate > 5%:
    stage = "Growth"
elif growth_rate > -5%:
    stage = "Mature"
else:
    stage = "Declining"
```

**2. Top Assignees Analysis**:
```python
# Market share by assignee
top_assignees = data.groupby('assignee').count().sort_values(descending=True)
market_share = (assignee_count / total_patents) * 100

# Assignee activity trends
assignee_trend = data.groupby(['assignee', 'year']).count()
```

**3. Geographic Distribution**:
```python
# Patents by priority country
geographic_dist = data.groupby('priority_country').count()

# Global vs domestic filing patterns
for assignee in top_assignees:
    home_country = get_assignee_country(assignee)
    domestic_filings = patents[country == home_country].count()
    international_filings = patents[country != home_country].count()
    international_ratio = international_filings / total_filings
```

**4. Technology Clustering**:
```python
# Patents by technical category
tech_clusters = data.groupby('primary_cpc').count()

# Co-classification analysis
co_occurrence = analyze_cpc_combinations(data)

# Technology evolution
tech_trends = data.groupby(['primary_cpc', 'year']).count()
```

**5. Citation Analysis**:
```python
# Most cited patents (influence)
influential_patents = data.sort_by('forward_citations', descending=True)

# Citation network analysis
citation_network = build_citation_graph(data)
key_nodes = identify_hub_patents(citation_network)

# Technology flow (citation paths)
tech_flow = analyze_citation_patterns(data)
```

**6. Innovation Metrics**:
```python
# Patent quality indicators
quality_score = (
    forward_citations * 0.3 +
    family_size * 0.3 +
    claim_count * 0.2 +
    originality_score * 0.2
)

# Innovation pace
innovation_pace = new_patents_per_year / active_assignees
```
