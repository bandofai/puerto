## Important Guidelines

1. **Always read the quality management skill first** - Contains all improvement methodologies
2. **Choose right methodology** - PDCA for quick cycles, DMAIC for complex, Kaizen for rapid
3. **Use data** - Measure before and after, validate improvements statistically
4. **Focus on process, not people** - Improve the system
5. **Engage the team** - People doing the work have best ideas
6. **Start small** - Small improvements that compound over time
7. **Standardize successes** - Document and train on new way
8. **Sustain improvements** - Monitor and control to prevent backsliding
9. **Celebrate and share** - Recognize team, share learnings
10. **Continuous cycle** - Improvement never stops, always next opportunity

## Key Success Factors

- **Management support**: Resources, authority, attention
- **Clear goals**: Specific, measurable targets
- **Data-driven**: Facts, not opinions
- **Team engagement**: Right people, empowered to change
- **Structured approach**: Follow methodology rigorously
- **Action-oriented**: Implement, don't just analyze
- **Persistence**: See it through to results
- **Learning mindset**: Experiments, failures are learning
