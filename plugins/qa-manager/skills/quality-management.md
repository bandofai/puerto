### Lean Manufacturing

Lean focuses on maximizing customer value while minimizing waste.

#### Eight Wastes (DOWNTIME)

1. **Defects**: Rework, scrap, incorrect information
2. **Overproduction**: Producing more than needed or before needed
3. **Waiting**: Idle time waiting for work, information, approvals
4. **Non-utilized Talent**: Not using people's skills, knowledge
5. **Transportation**: Unnecessary movement of materials, information
6. **Inventory**: Excess materials, work in progress, finished goods
7. **Motion**: Unnecessary movement of people (ergonomics)
8. **Extra Processing**: Doing more work than required by customer

#### Lean Principles

1. **Define Value**: What customer is willing to pay for
2. **Map Value Stream**: Identify all steps and eliminate waste
3. **Create Flow**: Make value-creating steps flow smoothly
4. **Establish Pull**: Produce only what customer demands
5. **Pursue Perfection**: Continuous improvement toward zero waste

#### Lean Tools

### PDCA Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act)

The PDCA cycle is a four-step iterative method for continuous improvement.

**Plan**
- Identify opportunity for improvement
- Analyze current situation
- Develop hypothesis
- Plan change or test

**Do**
- Implement change on small scale
- Collect data
- Document what happens

**Check**
- Analyze results

## Root Cause Analysis

### 5 Whys Technique

Ask "Why?" five times to drill down to root cause.

**Example**:
```
Problem: Website went down

1. Why did website go down?
   → Because database server crashed

2. Why did database server crash?
   → Because it ran out of disk space

3. Why did it run out of disk space?
   → Because logs were not being rotated

4. Why were logs not being rotated?
   → Because log rotation script was not configured

5. Why was log rotation script not configured?
   → Because deployment checklist didn't include log rotation setup

Root Cause: Incomplete deployment checklist
Corrective Action: Update deployment checklist to include log rotation
Preventive Action: Automate log rotation configuration in deployment script
```

**Tips**:
- May need more or fewer than 5 whys
- Stop when you reach actionable root cause
- Avoid blaming people (focus on process)
- Verify root cause with data

### Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)

Visual tool to identify potential causes of a problem.

**Six Main Categories (6Ms)**:
1. **Man/People**: Skills, training, knowledge, communication
2. **Method**: Procedures, processes, standards
3. **Machine**: Equipment, tools, technology
4. **Material**: Raw materials, components, inputs
5. **Measurement**: Metrics, data collection, accuracy
6. **Mother Nature/Environment**: Conditions, workspace, external factors

**Process**:
1. Define problem (fish head)
2. Identify main cause categories (bones)
3. Brainstorm potential causes for each category
4. Identify most likely root causes
5. Verify with data

**Example**:
```
Problem: High defect rate in production

People:
- Insufficient training on new features
- High turnover in QA team
- Lack of domain knowledge

Process:
- Inadequate code review process
- No automated testing for new features
- Rushed release schedule

Tools:
- Test environment doesn't match production
- No performance testing tools
- Outdated test data

Materials:
- Poor quality requirements documentation
- Incomplete design specifications

Measurement:
- No tracking of defect sources
- Limited test coverage metrics

Environment:
- Frequent priority changes
- Pressure to release quickly
```

### Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)

Top-down deductive analysis starting from undesired event.

**Symbols**:
- **AND Gate**: All inputs must occur for output to occur
- **OR Gate**: Any input occurrence causes output to occur
- **Basic Event**: Cannot be broken down further
- **Intermediate Event**: Can be analyzed further

**Process**:
1. Define top event (failure)
2. Identify immediate causes (AND/OR relationships)
3. Break down causes recursively
4. Identify basic events (root causes)
5. Calculate probabilities if data available

### Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)

80% of problems come from 20% of causes. Focus on vital few.

**Process**:
1. List problems or causes
2. Count frequency or impact of each
3. Calculate percentage of total
4. Calculate cumulative percentage
5. Create Pareto chart (bar chart + cumulative line)
6. Focus improvement on top 20% of causes

**Example**:
```
Defect Causes (100 total defects):
1. Missing input validation: 45 defects (45%)
2. Race conditions: 25 defects (25%)
3. Incorrect error handling: 15 defects (15%)
4. UI layout issues: 8 defects (8%)
5. Performance issues: 4 defects (4%)
6. Other: 3 defects (3%)

Focus on top 3 causes (85% of defects)
```

## Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA)

### CAPA Process

**Corrective Action**: Eliminates cause of detected nonconformity (fix the problem)
**Preventive Action**: Eliminates cause of potential nonconformity (prevent problem)

### CAPA Steps

**1. Problem Identification**
- Describe the problem
- When and where detected
- Impact assessment (severity, scope)
- Evidence and data

**2. Immediate Containment**
- Stop the bleeding
- Prevent further problems
- Quarantine nonconforming products
- Notify affected parties

**3. Root Cause Analysis**
- Use 5 Whys, Fishbone, or FTA
- Identify true root cause (not symptom)
- Validate with data

**4. Corrective Action Plan**
- Actions to eliminate root cause
- Who is responsible
- Target completion date
- Resources required

**5. Preventive Action Plan**
- Prevent recurrence
- Systematic changes (process, training, tools)
- Extend to similar processes/products

**6. Implementation**
- Execute action plan
- Document changes
- Communicate to affected parties

**7. Verification**
- Verify actions completed
- Check if problem resolved
- Monitor for recurrence

**8. Effectiveness Review**

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Quality Theater**: Following process without understanding purpose
2. **Over-Documentation**: Too much documentation, not enough action
3. **Analysis Paralysis**: Too much analysis, not enough improvement
4. **Blame Culture**: Blaming people instead of fixing processes
5. **Metric Gaming**: Optimizing metrics without improving quality
6. **Ignoring Root Cause**: Fixing symptoms, not root cause
7. **No Follow-up**: Implementing changes without verifying effectiveness
8. **Quality Silo**: QA separate from development, not integrated
9. **Perfection Paralysis**: Waiting for perfect solution, not starting
10. **No Leadership Support**: Improvement efforts without management commitment
