## Market Sizing Methodologies

### TAM/SAM/SOM Analysis

#### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
**Definition**: Total revenue opportunity if 100% market share achieved.

**Calculation Methods**:

**Top-Down Approach**:
```
TAM = Population × Penetration Rate × Average Price
```

Example (SaaS product in Germany):
```
Population: 83M people
Business users: 40% = 33.2M
Potential customers: 30% = 10M
Annual subscription: €100
TAM = 10M × €100 = €1B
```

**Bottom-Up Approach**:
```
TAM = Number of Accounts × Average Contract Value
```

Example:
```
Total companies in target segment: 50,000
Average annual contract: €20,000
TAM = 50,000 × €20,000 = €1B
```

**Value Theory Approach**:
```
TAM = Value created × Percentage captured
```

#### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)
**Definition**: Portion of TAM you can realistically serve with your product/business model.

**Constraints**:
- Geographic limitations
- Product capabilities
- Distribution channels
- Regulatory restrictions
- Language/localization
- Pricing tiers

**Calculation**:
```
SAM = TAM × Addressable %
```

Example:
```
TAM: €1B
Geographic reach: 60% (major cities only)
Product fit: 50% (mid-market only)
SAM = €1B × 60% × 50% = €300M
```

#### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
**Definition**: Portion of SAM you can realistically capture in near term (1-3 years).

**Factors**:
- Competitive position
- Sales/marketing capacity
- Brand recognition
- Resources available
- Time to scale

**Calculation**:
```
SOM = SAM × Realistic Market Share
```

Example:
```
SAM: €300M
Year 1 target share: 0.5%
Year 3 target share: 2%
SOM Year 1 = €300M × 0.5% = €1.5M
SOM Year 3 = €300M × 2% = €6M
```

**Market Share Benchmarks**:
- New entrant year 1: 0.1-1%
- Established player: 2-5%
- Market leader: 10-30%

### Demand Forecasting

#### Time Series Analysis
**Method**: Use historical data to project future demand.

**Techniques**:
- Moving averages
- Exponential smoothing
- Trend analysis
- Seasonal adjustment

**Formula (Simple)**:
```
Forecast = Base Demand × (1 + Growth Rate)^Years
```

#### Analogous Market Method
**Method**: Use similar market as proxy.

**Steps**:
1. Identify analogous market
2. Adjust for differences:
   - Population size
   - GDP per capita
   - Cultural factors
   - Market maturity
3. Apply adjustment factors

**Example**:
```
Reference market (Spain) revenue: €10M
Population ratio (Portugal/Spain): 0.22
GDP per capita ratio: 0.85
Adjustment factor: 0.9 (cultural similarity)

Portugal forecast = €10M × 0.22 × 0.85 × 0.9 = €1.68M
```

#### Survey-Based Forecasting

**Purchase Intent Survey**:
- "Definitely will buy": 75% probability
- "Probably will buy": 25% probability
- "Might buy": 10% probability

**Calculation**:
```
Expected buyers = (Definitely × 75%) + (Probably × 25%) + (Might × 10%)
Revenue forecast = Expected buyers × Average price × Purchase frequency
```
