**Duty and Tax Calculations**:
```
Import Duties:
├── Ad Valorem: Percentage of value (most common)
│   Example: 5% × $10,000 = $500
├── Specific: Per unit amount
│   Example: $2 per kg × 1,000 kg = $2,000
├── Compound: Combination of both
│   Example: 5% + $1/kg
└── Variable: Based on price or other factors

Value for Duty:
├── Transaction value (most common)
├── FOB (Free on Board) price
├── Plus: Freight, insurance to port of import
├── Plus: Packing costs
├── Plus: Assists (molds, dies provided to supplier)
└── Minus: Post-importation costs

Example Calculation:
Product value: $10,000 FOB
Freight: $500
Insurance: $100
CIF Value: $10,600
Duty rate: 5%
Duty: $530
VAT rate: 20%
VAT: ($10,600 + $530) × 20% = $2,226
Total: $10,600 + $530 + $2,226 = $13,356
