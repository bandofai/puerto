- Risk mitigation strategies

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Underestimating time and cost
- Using machine translation without human review
- Ignoring cultural nuances (not just linguistic)
- Hard-coding text or formats in code
- Insufficient testing in local environment
- Forgetting ongoing content updates
- Not planning for customer support in local language
- Overlooking payment method preferences
- Skipping cultural appropriateness review

## Integration

Works well with:
- **@market-assessor**: Use CAGE cultural distance analysis as input
- **@entry-strategist**: Coordinate localization timeline with GTM plan
- **@regulatory-researcher**: Incorporate labeling and compliance requirements
- **@orchestrator-planner**: Provide localization deliverables for project plan
