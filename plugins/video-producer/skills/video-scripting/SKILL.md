# Video Scripting Skill

Platform-optimized video script writing for engagement and retention.

## YouTube Script Structure (8-15 minutes)

### Hook (0:00-0:05) - CRITICAL
First 5 seconds determine 50%+ of viewers who continue watching.

Hook formulas:
- **Question**: "What if I told you [surprising fact]?"
- **Bold Claim**: "This one trick changed everything..."
- **Tease Best Moment**: "Wait until you see what happens at 8:32..."
- **Relatability**: "Have you ever struggled with [problem]?"
- **Shock/Awe**: "I spent $10,000 so you don't have to..."

### Intro (0:05-0:30)
- Who you are (if new viewers)
- What the video is about
- What they'll learn/gain (value proposition)
- Why they should keep watching

### Main Content (0:30-12:00)
- 3-5 clear sections/points
- Pattern interrupt every 30-60 seconds (visual change, B-roll, sound effect)
- Open loops (create questions, answer later)
- Callbacks to hook
- Preview what's coming ("But wait, there's more...")

### Call-to-Action (12:00-12:30)
- Like if you found value
- Subscribe for similar content
- Comment with questions/opinions
- Watch next video (related content)

## TikTok/Reels Script Structure (15-60 seconds)

### Second-by-Second Breakdown
**0-1s**: HOOK (must grab attention immediately)
- Visual: Show result/transformation
- Audio: Surprising statement
- Text: Bold claim

**1-3s**: Setup context quickly
- Who, what, why (minimal context)

**3-45s**: Deliver value/entertainment
- Fast-paced
- Text overlays for key points
- Music/trending sounds
- Visual variety (jump cuts every 2-3 seconds)

**45-60s**: Payoff + CTA
- Deliver on hook promise
- CTA: Like, follow, comment, share
- Loop potential (ends where it started for rewatching)

## LinkedIn Video Script (2-5 minutes)

### Professional Tone
- Data-driven content
- Industry insights
- Thought leadership
- Less entertainment, more value

### Structure
- **Problem** (0:00-0:30): Industry challenge
- **Context** (0:30-1:30): Why it matters, data points
- **Solution** (1:30-4:00): Your framework/approach
- **Proof** (4:00-4:30): Results, case study
- **CTA** (4:30-5:00): Comment, connect, check bio

## Script Writing Best Practices

### Pacing
- YouTube: Natural conversational pace
- TikTok/Reels: Fast, energetic
- LinkedIn: Professional but engaging
- Pause points for emphasis

### Language
- Write for speaking, not reading

- Contractions (you're, don't, can't)
- Conversational tone

### Engagement Techniques
- Ask questions (rhetorical or literal)
- Address viewer directly ("you")
- Use storytelling
- Create curiosity gaps
- Pattern interrupts

### SEO Integration (YouTube)
- Primary keyword in first 30 seconds
- Secondary keywords throughout
- Natural integration (not keyword stuffing)
- Include in visual text overlays

Include in script:
```

```
