## Spaced Repetition Algorithms

### SM-2 Algorithm (SuperMemo 2)

**Best for**: Long-term retention, large vocabulary sets

**How it works**:
```python
def sm2_review(quality, previous_interval, previous_ease_factor):
    """
    quality: 0-5 rating (5=perfect, 3=barely correct, 0=complete fail)
    previous_interval: days since last review
    previous_ease_factor: current ease (starts at 2.5)
    """

    # Update ease factor
    ease_factor = previous_ease_factor + (0.1 - (5 - quality) * (0.08 + (5 - quality) * 0.02))

    # Minimum ease factor
    if ease_factor < 1.3:
        ease_factor = 1.3

    # Calculate new interval
    if quality < 3:
        # Failed: reset to 1 day
        new_interval = 1
    else:
        if previous_interval == 0:
            # First review
            new_interval = 1
        elif previous_interval == 1:
            # Second review
            new_interval = 6
        else:
            # Subsequent reviews
            new_interval = round(previous_interval * ease_factor)

    return new_interval, ease_factor
```

**Quality ratings guide**:
- **5 (Perfect)**: Instant recall, effortless
- **4 (Good)**: Correct recall after brief thought
- **3 (Acceptable)**: Correct recall with difficulty or hesitation
- **2 (Hard)**: Incorrect but recognized when shown
- **1 (Difficult)**: Completely forgotten but somewhat familiar
- **0 (Complete fail)**: No recognition at all

**Typical intervals**:
```
Review 1: 1 day
Review 2: 6 days (if quality ≥ 3)
Review 3: 15 days (at ease 2.5)
Review 4: 37 days
Review 5: 90+ days
```

**Advantages**:
- Scientifically proven for long-term retention
- Adapts to individual difficulty
- Efficient use of study time

**Best practices**:
- Be honest with ratings (don't inflate)
- Review every day (consistency is key)
- Don't skip difficult items

### Leitner System

**Best for**: Simplicity, beginners, tangible progress

**How it works**:
```
5 Boxes with different review frequencies:

Box 1 (New/Difficult): Every day
Box 2: Every 3 days
Box 3: Every week
Box 4: Every 2 weeks
Box 5 (Mastered): Every month

Rules:
- Correct answer: Move to next box
- Incorrect answer: Move to Box 1
- Box 5 + correct: Stay in Box 5 (graduated)
```

**Example progression**:
```
Day 1: palabra → Box 1
Day 2: Review, correct → Box 2
Day 5: Review, correct → Box 3
Day 12: Review, correct → Box 4
Day 26: Review, correct → Box 5 (mastered!)
```

**Advantages**:
- Simple, easy to understand
- Tangible sense of progress
- Visual system (physical cards work well)

**Best practices**:
- Don't cheat by moving cards up incorrectly
- Review entire box on its day
- Celebrate Box 5 achievements

---

### Hybrid Approach

**Combine both**:
- Use Leitner for new vocabulary (first 5 reviews)
- Switch to SM-2 for long-term maintenance
- Best of both worlds: simplicity + optimization

## Vocabulary Acquisition Strategies

### The 7 Principles of Effective Vocabulary Learning

#### 1. **Context Over Isolation**

❌ **Bad**: Learn "comer = to eat" in isolation
✅ **Good**: Learn "Yo como una manzana = I eat an apple"

**Why**: Context provides:
- Usage examples
- Collocation patterns
- Memory anchors
- Meaning clarification

**Best practice**: Always add example sentences

---

#### 2. **Quality Over Quantity**

**Don't**: Add 50 words/day and forget them all
**Do**: Add 10-15 words/day and master them

**Sweet spot**:
- Beginners (A1-A2): 10-15 new words/day
- Intermediate (B1-B2): 15-20 new words/day
- Advanced (C1+): 20-30 new words/day

**Formula**: `new_words_per_day = review_capacity / 10`

If you can handle 150 reviews/day, add ~15 new words

---

#### 3. **Frequency First**

Learn common words before obscure ones.

**Priority order**:
1. Top 1000 most frequent words (cover ~80% of conversation)
2. Theme-based vocabulary for your needs (work, hobbies)
3. Grammar-specific words (conjunctions, particles)
4. Specialized/academic vocabulary

**Resources**:
- Frequency lists (e.g., Spanish Frequency Dictionary)
- CEFR-aligned word lists
- Theme-based sets

---

#### 4. **Multiple Exposures**

Don't learn a word once and expect mastery.

**Exposure types**:
1. Initial learning (conscious study)
2. Spaced repetition (active recall)
3. Immersion encounter (movies, reading)
4. Active use (conversation, writing)
5. Teaching others (explaining the word)

**Rule**: Need ~7-12 meaningful exposures for mastery

---

#### 5. **Deep Processing**

Surface-level: "libro = book"
Deep-level: "libro (masculine noun) - physical or digital book, from Latin 'liber', example: 'Estoy leyendo un libro interesante', related: biblioteca (library), librero (bookseller)"

**Deep processing techniques**:
- Write your own example sentences
- Draw connections to related words
- Note etymology or patterns
- Associate with personal memory
- Use in conversation

---

#### 6. **Organized Learning**

**Group words by**:
- Theme (food, travel, emotions)
- Word family (hablar, hablante, hablador)
- CEFR level
- Difficulty
- Part of speech

**Benefits**:
- Easier to review related words
- See patterns and connections
- Thematic context aids memory

---

#### 7. **Active Retrieval Practice**

Don't just review by reading.

**Retrieval methods**:
- Flashcards (target → native)
- Reverse cards (native → target)
- Sentence completion
- Usage in original sentences
- Conversation application

**Why it works**: Retrieval strengthens memory pathways more than passive review

---

### Vocabulary Milestones by CEFR Level

| Level | Words | What You Can Do |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| A1 | 500-1,000 | Basic needs, greetings, simple exchanges |
| A2 | 1,000-2,000 | Routine tasks, common situations |
| B1 | 2,000-3,500 | Most everyday situations, travel |
| B2 | 3,500-5,000 | Fluent conversation, news, films |
| C1 | 5,000-8,000 | Professional, academic contexts |
| C2 | 8,000+ | Native-like comprehension |

## Grammar Learning Frameworks

### The 4-Phase Grammar Mastery Model

#### Phase 1: **Understanding** (Comprehension)

**Goal**: Understand how the grammar works

**Activities**:
- Read clear explanations
- See abundant examples
- Compare with native language
- Identify patterns

**Output**: "I understand the rule"

---

#### Phase 2: **Recognition** (Receptive)

**Goal**: Recognize correct grammar when you see/hear it

**Activities**:
- Multiple choice (identify correct form)
- Error spotting (find mistakes)
- Listening/reading comprehension
- Passive exposure in immersion

**Output**: "I can spot correct vs incorrect usage"

---

#### Phase 3: **Production** (Active)

**Goal**: Use the grammar in controlled contexts

**Activities**:
- Fill-in-the-blank exercises
- Sentence translation
- Guided sentence creation
- Structured practice

**Output**: "I can form correct sentences with effort"

---

#### Phase 4: **Automaticity** (Fluent)

**Goal**: Use grammar naturally without thinking

**Activities**:
- Free conversation
- Spontaneous writing
- Rapid-fire exercises
- Real-world usage

**Output**: "I use it correctly without conscious thought"

**Time required**: Weeks to months depending on complexity

---

### Grammar Learning Best Practices

#### 1. **One Concept at a Time**

Don't: Learn present, past, and future tenses simultaneously
Do: Master present → add simple past → add future

**Why**: Prevents confusion and allows mastery

---

#### 2. **Spiral Learning**

Don't: Learn subjunctive once and move on
Do: Introduce subjunctive → use for months → deepen → expand

**Approach**:
```
Week 1: Subjunctive introduction (wishes: "Quiero que...")
Week 4: Review + add doubt expressions
Week 8: Review + add emotion triggers
Week 12: Review + add impersonal expressions
Ongoing: Continue using and expanding
```

---

#### 3. **Learn Through Example Patterns**

More effective than memorizing rules:

**Pattern**: "I want you to X" = "Quiero que [subjunctive]"

Examples:
- Quiero que vengas → I want you to come
- Quiero que estudies → I want you to study
- Quiero que sepas → I want you to know

Learn the pattern, vary the verb.

---

#### 4. **Error Correction**

**Approach**:
1. Make mistakes (it's learning!)
2. Get correction (tutor, app, self-check)
3. Understand why it was wrong
4. Practice correct form 3+ times
5. Move on (don't obsess)

**Don't**: Fear mistakes or avoid practice
**Do**: Welcome errors as learning opportunities

---

## Immersion Techniques

### The Immersion Pyramid

```
        Intensive Active (top)
              ↑
          Extensive Active
              ↑
          Intensive Passive
              ↑
        Extensive Passive (base)
```

#### **Extensive Passive** (Base - largest volume)

**What**: Background exposure, comprehension not required

**Examples**:
- Music in target language (while doing other tasks)
- TV/movies as background
- Podcasts while commuting

**Benefits**:
- Ear training (phonetics, rhythm, intonation)
- Subconscious pattern recognition
- Low effort, high volume possible

**Best for**: Building familiarity, maintaining exposure

---

#### **Intensive Passive** (Focused consumption)

**What**: Active listening/watching with focus on comprehension

**Examples**:
- Watching TV with subtitles (target language)
- Listening to podcasts with transcript
- Audiobooks while following text

**Benefits**:
- Comprehension development
- Vocabulary in context
- Cultural knowledge

**Best for**: Building receptive skills

---

#### **Extensive Active** (Light engagement)

**What**: Interactive but low-pressure production

**Examples**:
- Commenting on social media
- Journaling in target language
- Shadowing (repeating after audio)
- Singing along to songs

**Benefits**:
- Production practice without pressure
- Reinforcing vocabulary/structures
- Building confidence

**Best for**: Bridging passive to active skills

---

#### **Intensive Active** (Top - full engagement)

**What**: Focused production with feedback

**Examples**:
- Conversation with tutor/native
- Writing essays with correction
- Language exchange focused practice
- Deliberate speaking practice

**Benefits**:
- Skill development
- Error correction
- Fluency building

**Best for**: Rapid improvement, breaking plateaus

---

### Immersion Best Practices

#### 1. **i+1 Principle** (Comprehensible Input)

**Theory** (Stephen Krashen): Learn best with input slightly above current level

**Application**:
- A2 learner: 70% comprehension is ideal
- Too easy (95%+): Not challenging enough
- Too hard (40%): Frustrating, not helpful

**How to find i+1**:
- Use graded content for your level
- Choose familiar topics in harder language
- Use subtitles as training wheels

---

#### 2. **Balanced Immersion**

**Don't**: Only watch movies (passive listening)
**Do**: Mix all types

**Recommended balance**:
```
Listening: 40%
Reading: 30%
Speaking: 20%
Writing: 10%
```

Adjust based on goals (conversation → more speaking/listening)

---

#### 3. **Quantity Matters**

**Minimum effective dose**: 30+ minutes/day immersion
**Good target**: 1-2 hours/day
**Intensive**: 3-4 hours/day

**CEFR immersion requirements** (approximate):
- A1 → A2: 100 hours
- A2 → B1: 200 hours
- B1 → B2: 300 hours
- B2 → C1: 400 hours

**Total A1 → C1**: ~1000 hours of quality immersion

---

#### 4. **Active vs Passive Ratio**

Beginners (A1-A2): 30% active, 70% passive
Intermediate (B1-B2): 50% active, 50% passive
Advanced (C1+): 70% active, 30% passive

**Why**: Need comprehension base before production

---

## Motivation and Habits

### Building Sustainable Habits

#### **Start Small**

**Don't**: Commit to 2 hours/day from day 1
**Do**: Start with 15-20 minutes/day consistently

**Reason**: Sustainability > intensity

**Progression**:
```
Week 1-4: 15 min/day
Week 5-8: 20 min/day
Week 9-12: 30 min/day
Month 4+: 30-60 min/day
```

---

#### **Consistency Over Perfection**

**Better**: 20 minutes daily for 365 days (121 hours)
**Worse**: 3 hours once/week for a year (156 hours, but irregular)

**Why**: Spacing effect + habit formation

**Streak tracking**: Use calendar, app, or simple checkmarks

---

#### **Attachment to Existing Habits**

**Habit stacking**:
- "After my morning coffee, I review 20 flashcards"
- "During my commute, I listen to Spanish podcast"
- "Before bed, I journal 3 sentences in Spanish"

**Formula**: After [existing habit], I will [language practice]

---

#### **Intrinsic Motivation**

**Extrinsic** (less sustainable):
- Passing a test
- Impressing others
- Job requirement

**Intrinsic** (more sustainable):
- Enjoy the process
- Connect with culture
- Personal growth
- Communication with people

**Cultivate intrinsic**:
- Choose content you enjoy
- Connect with native speakers
- Explore culture (music, food, film)
- Set personal, meaningful goals

---

#### **Dealing with Plateaus**

**What**: Feeling like progress has stopped

**Why**: Normal! Skills consolidate before next leap

**Solutions**:
1. Change method (new resource, different practice type)
2. Increase challenge (harder content, faster speech)
3. Focus on weak area (if speaking is weak, add conversation)
4. Take short break (5-7 days off can help)
5. Reassess goals (maybe you've achieved more than you realize)

**Remember**: Plateaus are temporary and necessary

---

### Goal Setting Framework

#### **SMART Goals for Language Learning**

**Specific**: "Reach B1 Spanish" > "Get better at Spanish"

**Measurable**: "Learn 2,500 vocabulary words" > "Learn lots of words"

**Achievable**: "B1 in 12 months" > "Fluent in 3 months"

**Relevant**: Aligned with your purpose (travel, work, connection)

**Time-bound**: "By June 2026" > "Someday"

---

#### **Layered Goals**

```
Ultimate Goal (3-5 years):
└─ C1 Conversational Fluency

Annual Goal (1 year):
└─ Reach B1 Level

Quarterly Goal (3 months):
└─ Master A2 Grammar + 1,500 Words

Monthly Goal (30 days):
└─ Add 200 Words + Complete Past Tense

Weekly Goal (7 days):
└─ Review daily, 10 new words, 2 grammar exercises

Daily Goal (today):
└─ 20-minute vocabulary review, 10-minute listening
```

**Work backwards from ultimate goal to daily actions**
