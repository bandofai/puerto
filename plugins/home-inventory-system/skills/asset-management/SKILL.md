# Asset Management Skill

**Expert patterns for household asset cataloging, valuation, and insurance documentation**

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating professional home inventory systems that meet insurance requirements and industry best practices.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Documentation is Insurance**: Proper documentation can make the difference between full reimbursement and partial coverage in an insurance claim.

2. **Detail Over Speed**: Take time to document thoroughly. A missing serial number or photo can cost thousands in a claim dispute.

3. **Regular Updates**: Asset values change. Review and update valuations annually at minimum.

4. **Multiple Value Types**: Track purchase price, current market value, and replacement cost separately.

5. **Photo Everything**: Visual documentation is critical for insurance claims and identification.

## Depreciation Methods

### Straight-Line Depreciation

**Formula**:
```
Annual Depreciation = (Purchase Price - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
Current Value = Purchase Price - (Years Owned × Annual Depreciation)
```

**Example**:
- Purchase price: $1,000
- Salvage value: $100 (10%)
- Useful life: 10 years
- Annual depreciation: ($1,000 - $100) / 10 = $90/year
- Value after 3 years: $1,000 - ($90 × 3) = $730

**Best for**:
- Furniture
- Appliances
- Tools
- Items with predictable, steady depreciation

**Advantages**:
- Simple to calculate
- Predictable
- Easy to explain

**Disadvantages**:
- Doesn't reflect reality for electronics
- May overvalue old items
- Ignores condition changes

### Declining Balance Depreciation

**Formula**:
```
Annual Depreciation Rate = Percentage (e.g., 30%)
Value After Year N = Purchase Price × (1 - Rate)^N
```

**Example**:
- Purchase price: $1,000
- Depreciation rate: 30% per year
- Value after 1 year: $1,000 × 0.70 = $700
- Value after 2 years: $700 × 0.70 = $490
- Value after 3 years: $490 × 0.70 = $343

**Best for**:
- Electronics
- Computers and tablets
- Smartphones
- Technology that quickly becomes obsolete

**Advantages**:
- Reflects rapid early depreciation
- Realistic for technology
- Matches market behavior

**Disadvantages**:
- Can undervalue older items
- More complex calculation
- Rate selection requires judgment

### Typical Depreciation Rates by Category

| Category | Method | Rate/Life | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Electronics** | Declining | 30-40%/year | First 2-3 years rapid |
| **Computers** | Declining | 40%/year | Obsolete in 3-4 years |
| **Smartphones** | Declining | 40-50%/year | New models reduce value |
| **TVs** | Declining | 30%/year | Technology advances |
| **Furniture** | Straight-line | 10 years | Quality brands longer |
| **Appliances** | Straight-line | 10-15 years | Depends on type |
| **Tools (power)** | Straight-line | 10 years | Professional grade longer |
| **Tools (hand)** | Straight-line | 20 years | Minimal depreciation |
| **Jewelry** | None | Appreciate | Precious metals/gems |
| **Art** | None | Appreciate | Requires appraisal |
| **Designer bags** | Varies | 20%/year or appreciate | Depends on brand/rarity |
| **Collectibles** | None | Appreciate | Market dependent |
| **Exercise equipment** | Straight-line | 7 years | Home use |
| **Bicycles** | Declining | 20%/year | Depends on quality |

### Market Value Override

Always use actual market research to override depreciation calculations when:
- Item is discontinued/rare
- Market demand has changed
- Item has appreciated
- Comparable sales data is available
- High-value item (>$1,000)

- Aid identification after theft

### Essential Photos for Each Item

**Minimum Documentation**:
1. **Overall view**: Full item in good lighting
2. **Serial number/label**: Close-up showing make/model/serial
3. **Condition indicators**: Any wear, damage, or unique features

**Enhanced Documentation** (for items >$500):
4. **Multiple angles**: Front, back, sides
5. **In context**: Item in its location/room
6. **Scale reference**: Item with common object for size
7. **Details**: Special features, craftsmanship, materials

**Maximum Documentation** (for items >$2,000):
8. **Packaging/documentation**: Original box, manual, receipt
9. **Authentication**: Certificates, signatures, provenance
10. **Comparison**: Item next to similar objects or ruler
11. **Video walkthrough**: Detailed video examination

### Photo Technical Requirements

**Metadata Preservation**:
- Keep EXIF data (date, location if relevant)
- Don't over-compress (quality 85% or higher)
- Organize by item ID or room

**Photo Naming**:
```
[ITEM-ID]-[SEQUENCE]-[DESCRIPTION].jpg

Examples:
ITEM-001-1-overall.jpg
ITEM-001-2-serial-number.jpg
ITEM-001-3-condition.jpg
```

### Photography Workflow

1. **Prepare item**: Clean, stage in good lighting
2. **Shoot overall**: Full item, properly framed
3. **Shoot details**: Serial numbers, labels, unique features
4. **Shoot context**: Item in location (optional)

### Market Research Process

1. **Identify comparables**:
   - Same brand/model if available
   - Similar age and condition
   - Same features/specifications
   - Geographic proximity (local market)

2. **Collect data points**:
   - Find 5-10 comparable sales

   - Check if price includes shipping/fees

3. **Calculate median value**:
   - Remove outliers (very high/low)
   - Use median, not average
   - Weight recent sales more heavily
   - Adjust for condition differences

4. **Apply local factors**:
   - Market strength (urban vs rural)
   - Supply and demand
   - Seasonal variations
   - Economic conditions

5. **Document research**:
   ```json
   {
     "market_research": {
       "date": "2025-01-15",
       "sources": [
         {
           "source": "eBay",
           "url": "ebay.com/...",
           "price": 450.00,
           "date": "2025-01-10",
           "condition": "used-good"
         },
         {
           "source": "Craigslist",
           "url": "craigslist.org/...",
           "price": 425.00,
           "date": "2025-01-12",
           "condition": "used-good"
         }
       ],
       "median_value": 437.50,
       "notes": "Active market, consistent pricing"
     }
   }
   ```

### Condition Grading

**Grading Scale**:

**Excellent (90-100% of calculated value)**:
- Like new condition
- No visible wear
- All original parts/accessories
- Original packaging (if applicable)
- Fully functional

**Good (70-85% of calculated value)**:
- Minor cosmetic wear
- Fully functional
- May have minor scratches
- All essential parts present
- Normal use signs

**Fair (50-65% of calculated value)**:
- Noticeable wear
- May have cosmetic damage
- Fully functional
- Some parts may be missing (non-essential)
- Shows regular use

**Poor (25-45% of calculated value)**:
- Significant wear or damage
- May have functional issues
- Missing parts
- Needs repair
- Limited remaining useful life

**Parts/Salvage (<25% of calculated value)**:
- Not functional
- Significant damage
- Value only in parts
- Repair cost exceeds value

### Replacement Cost Estimation

**New Equivalent**:
- Find current model with similar features
- Adjust for technology improvements
- Consider current retail price
- Add delivery/installation if significant

**Example**:
- 2020 Samsung 65" TV, paid $1,200
- 2025 equivalent: Samsung 65" with better specs
- Current retail: $1,500
- Replacement cost: $1,500 (not original $1,200)

**When Exact Replacement Not Available**:
- Find closest current equivalent
- Match key specifications
- Consider quality level
- Document substitution reasoning
