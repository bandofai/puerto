## Store Layout Mapping

Load and understand store layouts:

**Store layout structure**:
```json
{
  "store_id": "whole-foods-downtown",
  "store_name": "Whole Foods - Downtown",
  "layout_type": "linear",
  "sections": [
    {
      "section_id": "produce",
      "name": "Produce",
      "location": "entrance-right",
      "aisle": null,
      "position": 1,
      "subsections": ["fruits", "vegetables", "herbs", "salad-bar"]
    },
    {
      "section_id": "bakery",
      "name": "Bakery",
      "location": "front-left",
      "aisle": null,
      "position": 2
    },
    {
      "section_id": "meat",
      "name": "Meat & Seafood",
      "location": "back-wall",
      "aisle": null,
      "position": 3
    },
    {
      "section_id": "dairy",
      "name": "Dairy",
      "location": "back-right",
      "aisle": null,
      "position": 4
    },
    {
      "section_id": "frozen",
      "name": "Frozen Foods",
      "location": "back-center",
      "aisle": null,
      "position": 5
    },
    {
      "section_id": "pantry",
      "name": "Pantry Staples",
      "aisles": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
      "position": 6
    },
    {
      "section_id": "snacks",
      "name": "Snacks",
      "aisles": [6, 7],
      "position": 7
    },
    {
      "section_id": "beverages",
      "name": "Beverages",
      "aisles": [8, 9],
      "position": 8
    },
    {
      "section_id": "household",
      "name": "Household",
      "aisles": [10, 11],
      "position": 9
    },
    {
      "section_id": "personal-care",
      "name": "Personal Care",
      "aisles": [12],
      "position": 10
    }
  ],
  "entrance": "front-center",
  "checkout": "front",
  "special_notes": "Refrigerated items should be collected last"
}
```

**Common layout patterns**:

1. **Linear/Racetrack**: Perimeter loop with center aisles
   - Best path: Perimeter first, then aisles
   - Example: Whole Foods, Trader Joe's

2. **Grid**: Straight parallel aisles
   - Best path: Serpentine (zigzag through aisles)
   - Example: Walmart, Target

3. **Boutique**: Irregular sections
   - Best path: Custom routing per store
   - Example: Specialty stores

## Efficient Path Planning

**Core algorithm principles**:

1. **Minimize backtracking**: Never return to a section
2. **Temperature zones**: Frozen/refrigerated items last
3. **Fragile items**: Produce and bread later to avoid crushing
4. **Heavy items**: Later in route (less carrying time)
5. **Start perimeter, end center**: Most efficient for linear layouts

**Optimized section order** (linear layout):
```
1. Bakery (sturdy bread)
2. Meat & Seafood (protein, goes in bottom of cart)
3. Produce (fruits/vegetables - moderately fragile)
4. Pantry/Aisles (dry goods - bulk of items)
5. Snacks (packaged, won't crush easily)
6. Beverages (heavy, won't crush other items)
7. Household (if needed)
8. Personal Care (if needed)
9. Dairy (refrigerated, near end)
10. Frozen (absolute last - temperature sensitive)
```

**Path optimization example**:

Input shopping list:
- Milk (dairy)
- Bananas (produce)
- Ice cream (frozen)
- Bread (bakery)
- Pasta (pantry, aisle 3)
- Chicken (meat)
- Chips (snacks, aisle 6)

Naive order (list order): Bakery → Produce → Dairy → Frozen → Pantry → Meat → Snacks
- Walking distance: ~850 ft
- Backtracking: Yes (return to perimeter after aisles)
- Ice cream melting risk: HIGH

Optimized order: Bakery → Meat → Produce → Pantry (aisle 3) → Snacks (aisle 6) → Dairy → Frozen
- Walking distance: ~520 ft
- Backtracking: None
- Ice cream melting risk: LOW
- Time saved: ~40%

## Multi-Store Comparison

When items are spread across stores, analyze best strategy:

**Analysis factors**:
- Item availability per store
- Price differences (if price data available)
- Distance between stores
- Time required for each store
- Gas/travel costs
- Total savings vs. convenience

**Single store vs. multi-store decision**:

```
Single Store Strategy:
+ Convenience: One trip
+ Time: Less total shopping time
+ Gas: Lower fuel cost
- Price: May pay more for some items
- Selection: May need substitutions

Multi-Store Strategy:
+ Price: Maximize savings
+ Selection: Get exactly what you want
- Time: More total shopping time
- Gas: Higher fuel cost
- Complexity: Manage multiple lists
```

**Multi-store optimization example**:

Shopping list items: 24 total

Store A (Whole Foods) - 18 items available:
- Organic produce: $45
- Specialty items: $32
- Total: $77

Store B (Trader Joe's) - 24 items available:
- Same produce: $35
- Same specialty: $28
- Total: $63
- Distance from Store A: 2.3 miles

Store C (Safeway) - 24 items available:
- Same produce: $30
- Same specialty: $25
- Total: $55
- Distance from Store A: 4.1 miles
- Distance from Store B: 3.2 miles

**Analysis**:
```
Option 1: Single store (Store C)
- Total cost: $55
- Total time: 35 minutes shopping
- Gas cost: ~$1.50 round trip
- Overall cost: $56.50
- Convenience: ★★★★★

Option 2: Two stores (Store B + Store C for unavailable items)
- Total cost: $63 + $8 (6 items at Store C) = $71
- Total time: 60 minutes shopping + 15 minutes driving
- Gas cost: ~$3.50
- Overall cost: $74.50
- Convenience: ★★☆☆☆
- Savings vs single store: -$18

Recommendation: Single store (Store C)
Reason: Best value when considering time, gas, and convenience
Savings: $18.50 vs multi-store, acceptable quality

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

**Time-based optimization**:
- Express trip (<15 min): Only grab essentials
- Quick trip (<30 min): Stick to list, efficient path
- Full shop (>30 min): Can browse sales, compare

**Cart loading strategy**:
```
Bottom of cart:
- Heavy items (beverages, canned goods)
- Sturdy items (boxes, bags)

Middle of cart:
- Medium-weight items
- Moderately fragile items

Top/child seat:
- Bread (won't get crushed)
- Eggs (visible, won't forget)
- Fragile items

Separate bag/basket:
- Produce (to prevent bruising)
- Items for different households
```

**Peak hour considerations**:
```
Best shopping times (less crowded):
- Early morning (7-9 AM): Fastest, freshest produce
- Mid-afternoon (2-4 PM): Moderate crowds
- Late evening (8-9 PM): Fast but picked-over

Avoid:
- Weekends (10 AM - 6 PM): Peak crowds
- After work (5-7 PM): Very crowded
- Before holidays: Extremely crowded
```

## Quality Standards

- [ ] Shopping list loaded successfully
- [ ] Store layout(s) mapped
- [ ] Route optimized to minimize distance
- [ ] Temperature-sensitive items ordered last
- [ ] Fragile items protected
- [ ] Multi-store analysis completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Clear step-by-step navigation provided
- [ ] Estimated time and distance calculated
- [ ] Output saved in accessible location

## Edge Cases

**Missing store layout**:
- Use standard category order (produce → dairy → frozen)
- Warn user about suboptimal routing
- Suggest creating store layout for future

**Split items across aisles**:
- Group by primary location
- Note secondary locations
- Minimize back-and-forth

**Seasonal layout changes**:
- Flag potential layout updates needed
- Suggest verifying in-store
- Update layout file after confirmation

**Store out of stock**:
- Mark items as "verify availability"
- Suggest alternatives
- Plan backup store option

**Very small list (<5 items)**:
- Skip complex routing
- Provide simple location list
- Optimize for speed

## Output

Provide comprehensive navigation plan:
```
Optimized shopping route created: ~/Downloads/shopping-route-20251021.json

Store: Whole Foods - Downtown
Total items: 24
Estimated time: 35 minutes
Estimated distance: 520 feet
Optimization: 38% time savings vs. unoptimized
