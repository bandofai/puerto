- Balanced presentation of alternatives
- Proper attribution and citation
- Decision-maker focus

---

## Part 1: Research Design & Planning

### 1.1 Defining Research Objectives

**SMART Research Objectives**:
- **Specific**: "Compare CRM platforms for 50-person sales team" not "Research CRMs"
- **Measurable**: Define success criteria and evaluation metrics
- **Achievable**: Scope matches available resources and timeline
- **Relevant**: Aligned with actual decision to be made
- **Time-bound**: Clear deadline for decision

**Research Question Framework**:
```
Primary Question: What [decision] should we make?
  ↓
Sub-questions:
  - What are the viable alternatives?
  - What criteria matter most?
  - What are the trade-offs?
  - What are the risks?
  - What's the best fit for our context?
```

### 1.2 Scoping Research

**Inclusion Criteria** (What to research):
- Alternatives that meet minimum requirements
- Information relevant to decision criteria
- Recent data (generally < 2 years for technology)
- Credible, verifiable sources

**Exclusion Criteria** (What to skip):
- Alternatives that fail deal-breakers
- Outdated or superseded information
- Unverifiable claims
- Irrelevant tangents

**Scope Statement Template**:
```markdown
## Research Scope

**Objective**: [Clear decision to be made]

**Alternatives**: [Specific options to compare]

**Evaluation Criteria**: [How alternatives will be assessed]

**In Scope**:
- [What will be researched]

**Out of Scope**:
- [What won't be covered]

**Timeline**: [When decision is needed]

**Deliverable**: [What output is required]
```

### 1.3 Selecting Research Frameworks

**Framework Selection Matrix**:

| Research Type | Primary Framework | Complementary |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Product Comparison | Feature Matrix + Weighted Scoring | SWOT, Cost-Benefit |
| Technology Evaluation | Requirements Checklist + TCO | Technical Assessment, Risk Matrix |
| Vendor Selection | Weighted Scoring + Due Diligence | Reference Checks, Contract Analysis |
| Strategic Decision | PESTLE + SWOT | Scenario Analysis, Stakeholder Map |
| Market Research | Porter's Five Forces | PESTLE, Competitive Analysis |
| Feasibility Study | Cost-Benefit + Risk Assessment | SWOT, Resource Analysis |

## Part 2: Source Evaluation & Data Collection

### 2.1 Source Credibility Framework

**Credibility Hierarchy**:

**Tier 1: Highly Credible** (Primary reliance)
- Official product documentation
- Published academic research
- Established analyst firms (Gartner, Forrester, IDC)
- Primary data (direct testing, surveys you conduct)

**Tier 2: Generally Credible** (Strong supporting evidence)
- Reputable tech publications (peer-reviewed or editorial oversight)
- Verified user review platforms (G2, Capterra, Trustpilot)
- Industry association reports
- Expert practitioner blogs (established credibility)

**Tier 3: Use with Caution** (Corroborate with other sources)
- Vendor marketing materials
- Unverified user reviews
- Opinion pieces without data
- Dated information (>2 years)

**Tier 4: Generally Not Credible** (Avoid or flag heavily)
- Anonymous sources
- Contradicted by credible sources
- Obvious marketing spin without substantiation
- Significantly outdated (>5 years for tech)

### 2.2 CRAAP Test for Source Evaluation

**Currency**:
- When was it published/updated?
- Is it current enough for your decision?
- Have things changed since publication?

**Relevance**:
- Does it address your research question?
- Is it at the right level (not too basic/advanced)?
- Is it relevant to your context?

**Authority**:
- Who is the author/publisher?
- What are their credentials?
- Do they have expertise in this area?
- Is there contact information?

**Accuracy**:
- Is information supported by evidence?
- Can you verify claims independently?
- Are sources cited?
- Is language neutral and professional?

**Purpose**:
- Why was this created?
- Is there bias or agenda?
- Is it to inform, sell, or persuade?
- Are limitations acknowledged?

### 2.3 Multi-Source Triangulation

**Triangulation Strategy**:
```
Claim: "Product X handles 100k transactions/second"

Verification:
1. Official docs: "Up to 100k TPS under optimal conditions"
2. Technical benchmark: "Achieved 87k TPS in our test"
3. User review: "We process 60k TPS reliably in production"

Analysis:
- Official claim is theoretical maximum
- Real-world is lower (60-87k range)
- Conclusion: Capable of high throughput but actual varies by config
```

**Source Diversity**:
- **Official perspective**: What vendor says
- **Expert perspective**: What analysts/reviewers say
- **User perspective**: What actual users experience
- **Technical perspective**: What documentation/testing shows

### 2.4 Handling Conflicting Information

**When Sources Disagree**:

1. **Check currency**: More recent source may reflect updates
2. **Assess credibility**: Weight more credible source higher
3. **Consider context**: Different use cases may yield different results
4. **Seek additional sources**: Find tiebreaker evidence
5. **Document conflict**: Note disagreement and your resolution logic

**Conflict Documentation Template**:
```json
{
  "conflict": {
    "topic": "What sources disagree about",
    "source_A": {
      "claim": "What Source A says",
      "source": "Citation",
      "credibility": "Tier 1/2/3",
      "date": "When published"
    },
    "source_B": {
      "claim": "What Source B says",
      "source": "Citation",
      "credibility": "Tier 1/2/3",
      "date": "When published"
    },
    "resolution": "How conflict was resolved",
    "final_conclusion": "What you're reporting",
    "confidence": "High/Medium/Low"
  }
}
```

## Part 3: Comparative Analysis Frameworks

### 3.1 Feature Comparison Matrix

**Matrix Structure**:
```markdown
| Feature/Capability | [Alt 1] | [Alt 2] | [Alt 3] | Analysis |
|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Core feature 1 | ✅ Full | 🟡 Partial | ❌ No | Alt 1 advantage |
| Core feature 2 | Details | Details | Details | Comparison note |
```

**Comparison Symbols**:
- ✅ Fully supported / Excellent
- 🟡 Partially supported / Good / Limited
- ❌ Not supported / Poor
- ➖ Not applicable
- ❓ Unknown / Insufficient data

**Best Practices**:
- Group features by category
- Use consistent evaluation scale
- Provide details beyond checkmarks
- Cite sources for claims
- Note important caveats
- Add "Analysis" column for insights

### 3.2 SWOT Analysis

**SWOT Framework**:
```
         Internal         |         External
─────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────
  STRENGTHS (Positive)   |   OPPORTUNITIES (Positive)
  - Internal capabilities|   - External factors to leverage
  - What it does well    |   - Market trends
  - Competitive advantages|  - Growth potential
─────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────
  WEAKNESSES (Negative)  |   THREATS (Negative)
  - Internal limitations |   - External risks
  - What it lacks        |   - Competition
  - Disadvantages        |   - Market challenges
```

**SWOT Best Practices**:
- **Specific**: "24/7 customer support" not "good support"
- **Evidence-based**: Cite sources for each point
- **Strategic**: Focus on decision-relevant factors
- **Actionable**: What can be leveraged or mitigated
- **Balanced**: Don't over-emphasize positives or negatives

**SWOT to Decision**:
```
Strengths + Opportunities = Maximize these
Strengths + Threats = Use strengths to counter threats
Weaknesses + Opportunities = Overcome weaknesses to seize opportunities
Weaknesses + Threats = Highest risk; plan mitigation
```

### 3.3 Weighted Decision Matrix

**Scoring Framework**:

**Step 1: Define Criteria with Weights**
```markdown
| Criterion | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Must-have feature | Critical (Pass/Fail) | Eliminates alternatives |
| Primary need | 30% | Most important driver |
| Secondary need | 25% | Very important |
| Nice-to-have | 15% | Valuable but not essential |
```

**Total weights must = 100%**

**Step 2: Score Each Alternative**
```
Scale: 1-5 (or 1-10)
1 = Poor / Does not meet
2 = Below average / Partially meets
3 = Average / Meets basic requirement
4 = Good / Exceeds requirement
5 = Excellent / Far exceeds requirement
```

**Step 3: Calculate Weighted Scores**
```
Weighted Score = Raw Score × Weight

Example:
Criterion: Ease of Use (Weight: 25%)
Alternative A: Score 4/5
Weighted Score: 4 × 0.25 = 1.00

Total Score = Sum of all weighted scores
```

**Step 4: Interpret Results**
```
Score Range | Interpretation
4.5 - 5.0   | Exceptional fit
4.0 - 4.4   | Excellent fit
3.5 - 3.9   | Good fit
3.0 - 3.4   | Acceptable fit
< 3.0       | Poor fit / Not recommended
```

**Sensitivity Analysis**:
```
Test: What if weights change?
- Increase [Criterion X] weight by 10%
- Does top recommendation change?
- If yes: Decision is weight-sensitive
- If no: Decision is robust
```

### 3.4 Pros/Cons Analysis

**Structured Pros/Cons**:

**Categorize by Impact**:
- **Major** (⭐⭐⭐ / ⚠️⚠️⚠️): Deal-makers or deal-breakers
- **Notable** (⭐⭐ / ⚠️⚠️): Significant but not decisive
- **Minor** (⭐ / ⚠️): Worth noting but low impact

**Pro/Con Template**:
```markdown
### [Alternative Name]

#### Major Strengths ⭐⭐⭐
1. **[Strength]**
   - Evidence: [Data/quote from source]
   - Source: [Citation]
   - Impact: [Why this matters significantly]

#### Major Weaknesses ⚠️⚠️⚠️
1. **[Weakness]**
   - Evidence: [Data/quote]
   - Source: [Citation]
   - Impact: [Why this is problematic]
   - Mitigation: [Can this be worked around?]
```

**Pros/Cons Analysis Rules**:
1. Evidence required for each point
2. Impact level must be justified
3. Balance: Don't cherry-pick only positives or negatives
4. Context: Explain why pro/con matters for this use case
5. Mitigation: Address how cons can be minimized

### 3.5 Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**:
```
TCO = Initial Costs + Ongoing Costs + Hidden Costs - Residual Value

Initial Costs:
- License/purchase price
- Implementation/setup
- Training
- Integration/customization
- Migration from existing system

Ongoing Costs (per year):
- Subscription/license renewals
- Maintenance/support
- Staffing (admin, management)
- Additional usage fees
- Upgrades

Hidden Costs:
- Downtime during migration
- Reduced productivity during learning curve
- Opportunity cost of staff time

Residual Value:
- Can it be sold/repurposed?
- Does contract have value beyond project?
```

**Benefit Quantification**:
```
Tangible Benefits (Quantifiable):
- Time saved: [X hours/week] × [hourly rate] = $Y/year
- Cost reduction: [Specific expense reduced] = $Z/year
- Revenue enabled: [New capability value] = $W/year

Intangible Benefits (Harder to quantify):
- Improved user satisfaction
- Better decision-making
- Reduced risk
- Competitive advantage
- Employee morale

Approach: Attempt to quantify even intangibles
Example: "Improved satisfaction → 10% lower churn → $X retained revenue"
```

**ROI Calculation**:
```
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100%

Payback Period = Total Investment / Annual Net Benefit

Example:
Investment: $50,000
Annual Benefit: $30,000
Annual Cost: $10,000
Annual Net Benefit: $20,000

ROI = ($100k benefits - $50k costs) / $50k × 100% = 100%
Payback: $50k / $20k per year = 2.5 years
```

### 3.6 Risk Assessment Matrix

**Risk Framework**:
```
Risk = Likelihood × Impact

Likelihood:
- High (>50% chance): Likely to occur
- Medium (10-50%): Possible
- Low (<10%): Unlikely

Impact:
- High: Severe consequences (project failure, major cost)
- Medium: Significant but manageable
- Low: Minor inconvenience

Risk Priority:
High Likelihood + High Impact = Critical (address immediately)
High Likelihood + Medium Impact = Important (plan mitigation)
Medium Likelihood + High Impact = Important (monitor closely)
Low Likelihood + Low Impact = Accept (note but don't worry)
```

**Risk Documentation**:
```markdown
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|----------|------------|
| [Risk description] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | Critical/Important/Low | [Strategy] |
```

## Part 4: Decision-Making Frameworks

### 4.1 Must-Have / Nice-to-Have

**Categorization**:
- **Must-Have**: Non-negotiable requirements
  - Alternative MUST meet these or is eliminated
  - Examples: Budget constraints, security requirements, compatibility needs

- **Important**: Significant factors with weight
  - Scored and weighted in decision matrix
  - Examples: Key features, performance targets, support quality

- **Nice-to-Have**: Differentiators but not essential
  - Lower weight in scoring
  - Tiebreakers if primary criteria are equal
  - Examples: Extra features, aesthetic preferences

### 4.2 Elimination Decision Process

**Multi-Stage Decision**:
```
Stage 1: Eliminate Must-Have Failures
├─ Check all alternatives against must-haves
├─ Eliminate any that fail critical requirements
└─ Remaining alternatives proceed to scoring

Stage 2: Weighted Scoring
├─ Score remaining alternatives on important criteria
├─ Calculate weighted totals
└─ Rank by score

Stage 3: Deep Dive on Top Options
├─ Detailed analysis of top 2-3
├─ Review pros/cons thoroughly
└─ Consider contextual factors

Stage 4: Recommendation
├─ Select top alternative
├─ Justify with evidence
└─ Acknowledge trade-offs
```

### 4.3 Scenario-Based Decision Making

**Scenario Testing**:
```markdown
## Baseline Scenario
Current assumptions: [List]
Recommendation: [Alternative X]

## Scenario 1: Budget Constrained
Assumption change: Budget reduced 30%
Impact: [Alternative Y] becomes top choice
Reason: [Why]

## Scenario 2: Scale Priority
Assumption change: Expect 10x growth
Impact: [Alternative Z] becomes top choice
Reason: [Better scaling]

## Scenario 3: Speed to Market
Assumption change: Need live in 2 weeks not 3 months
Impact: [Alternative W] becomes top choice
Reason: [Faster implementation]
```

**Adaptive Recommendation**:
```
Primary Recommendation: [Alt X] under baseline assumptions

Choose [Alt Y] if: [Specific condition]
Choose [Alt Z] if: [Different condition]
```

### 4.4 Confidence Assessment

**Confidence Framework**:
```
High Confidence:
✅ Comprehensive data across all criteria
✅ Multiple credible sources agree
✅ Clear score differentiation (>0.5 points)
✅ Decision is robust to weight changes
✅ Low uncertainty in key factors

Medium Confidence:
🟡 Good data but some gaps
🟡 Sources mostly agree with minor conflicts
🟡 Moderate score differentiation (0.2-0.5)
🟡 Some sensitivity to weight changes
🟡 Some uncertainty in secondary factors

Low Confidence:
⚠️ Significant data gaps
⚠️ Conflicting sources
⚠️ Very close scores (<0.2 difference)
⚠️ High sensitivity to assumptions
⚠️ Major uncertainties in key factors
```

**When Confidence is Low**:
- Recommend additional research
- Suggest pilot/proof-of-concept
- Propose phased decision
- Highlight what would increase confidence

- **Style**: Clear, concise, confident
- **Structure**: Lead with the recommendation

**Executive Summary Template**:
```markdown
## Executive Summary

**Objective**: [What decision needed to be made - 1 sentence]

**Recommendation**: We recommend [Alternative X] for [use case/organization].

**Key Rationale**:
1. [Reason 1 with data point]
2. [Reason 2 with data point]
3. [Reason 3 with data point]

- Be specific: "4.5/5 rating" not "highly rated"
- Define jargon: "SaaS (Software as a Service)"
- Break up dense text: Use lists, tables, headers
- Highlight key points: Bold, bullet points, callouts

**Accessibility Principles**:
- Assume intelligent but non-expert reader
- Explain technical terms when first used
- Provide context for numbers
- Use analogies when helpful
- Make complex concepts digestible

### 7.4 Visual Communication

**Effective Tables**:
- Clear column headers
- Consistent formatting
