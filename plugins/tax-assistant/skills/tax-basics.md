# Tax Basics Skill

## Overview
Comprehensive guide to tax filing fundamentals, forms, deadlines, filing status, deductions (standard vs itemized), common tax credits, estimated quarterly taxes, and tax planning strategies for individuals and small businesses.

## Tax Filing Basics

### Understanding the Tax System

**Progressive Tax System**:
```
US uses graduated tax brackets
Higher income = higher marginal rate (not all income!)

Example: Single filer, $100,000 income (2024)
Does NOT pay 24% on all income

Actual calculation:
$0 - $11,600: 10% = $1,160
$11,601 - $47,150: 12% = $4,266
$47,151 - $100,525: 22% = $11,743
$100,526 - $100,000: 24% = $0 (doesn't reach this bracket)

Total tax: $17,169
Effective rate: 17.2% (not 24%!)
Marginal rate: 22% (top bracket reached)
```

**Federal vs State vs Local Taxes**:
```
Federal Income Tax:
- IRS (Internal Revenue Service)
- Same rates nationwide
- Most forms/complexity

State Income Tax:
- Varies by state
- 0% (TX, FL, WA, NV, etc.) to 13.3% (CA)
- Separate filing required

Local Taxes:
- City/county income taxes (some areas)
- Property taxes
- Sales taxes
- Usually simpler
```

**Taxable Income Calculation**:
```
Gross Income (wages, interest, dividends, etc.)
- Above-the-Line Deductions (adjustments)
= Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)
- Standard Deduction OR Itemized Deductions
- QBI Deduction (if applicable)
= Taxable Income
× Tax Rate
= Tax Owed
- Tax Credits
- Withholding/Payments
= Tax Due or Refund
```

### Key Tax Forms

**Form 1040 (Individual Income Tax Return)**:
```
The main form - everyone uses this

Sections:
- Filing status
- Dependents
- Income (W-2, 1099s, etc.)

```

**Form W-4 (Employee's Withholding Certificate)**:
```
Give to employer - controls tax withholding

When to Update:
- New job
- Marriage/divorce
- Child born
- Buying house (mortgage interest deduction)
- Side income changes
- Large refund/owed last year

Goal: Withhold correct amount
- Not too much (interest-free loan to government)
- Not too little (owe at tax time + potential penalties)

Use IRS Withholding Calculator: irs.gov/W4App
```

**Form 1040-ES (Estimated Tax Payments)**:
```
For self-employed, side income, investments

Required if:
- Expect to owe $1,000+ in taxes
- Withholding < 90% of current year tax
- Withholding < 100% of prior year tax (110% if AGI >$150K)

Quarterly Deadlines:
- Q1 (Jan-Mar): April 15
- Q2 (Apr-May): June 15
- Q3 (Jun-Aug): September 15
- Q4 (Sep-Dec): January 15 (next year)

Calculation:
Estimate annual income → Calculate tax → Divide by 4
Or: Use prior year tax / 4 (safe harbor)
```

### Tax Filing Deadlines

**Important Dates (2024 Tax Year)**:
```
January 31, 2025:
- W-2s due from employers
- 1099s due (most types)
- Form 1099-NEC due (contractor payments)

February 15, 2025:
- Form 1099-B due (brokerage)

April 15, 2025:
- Individual tax returns due (Form 1040)
- Q1 estimated tax payment due (2025 tax year)
- Deadline to contribute to IRA (2024 tax year)
- Deadline to contribute to HSA (2024 tax year)

June 15, 2025:
- Q2 estimated tax payment due

September 15, 2025:
- Q3 estimated tax payment due
- Extended returns due (if requested extension)

October 15, 2025:
- Extended returns due (if requested by April 15)

January 15, 2026:
- Q4 estimated tax payment due (2025 tax year)
```

**Extensions**:
```
Form 4868: Automatic Extension to October 15

Important:
✅ Extends filing deadline
❌ Does NOT extend payment deadline

Process:
1. File Form 4868 by April 15
2. Pay estimated tax owed by April 15
3. File actual return by October 15

Why Request:
- Need more time to gather documents
- Complex tax situation
- Waiting on K-1s (partnerships)
- Expatriates abroad

Penalties:
If don't file extension and late: 5% per month (up to 25%)
If don't pay on time: 0.5% per month + interest
```

**Penalties for Late Filing/Payment**:
```
Failure to File:
- 5% of unpaid taxes per month
- Maximum 25% (5 months)
- Minimum $450 or 100% of tax (if 60+ days late)

Failure to Pay:
- 0.5% of unpaid taxes per month
- Maximum 25% (50 months)

Interest:
- Federal short-term rate + 3%
- Compounds daily
- Currently ~8% (varies quarterly)

Example:
Owe $5,000, file 3 months late, pay 3 months late
Failure to file: $5,000 × 5% × 3 = $750
Failure to pay: $5,000 × 0.5% × 3 = $75
Interest: ~$100
Total penalties: $925 on $5,000 tax owed! 😱

```

### Itemization Strategy

**Bunching Deductions**:
```
Strategy: Accelerate deductions into one year

Example - Charitable Giving:
Normal: $8,000/year for 2 years = $16,000

Bunched:
Year 1: $16,000 (itemize!)
Year 2: $0 (take standard deduction)

Year 1:
Itemized: $26,000 (with other deductions)
Standard: $29,200
Benefit: $0 (standard is better)

Wait - reverse strategy:
Year 1: $16,000 + $15,000 other = $31,000 itemized
Year 2: $0 + $15,000 other = $15,000 (use standard $29,200)

Total benefit: ($31,000 + $29,200) = $60,200
vs. normal: ($23,000 + $23,000) = $46,000
Extra deductions: $14,200 🎉

Tools:
- Donor-Advised Funds (contribute lumpsumm, distribute over years)
- Prepay property taxes
- Schedule elective medical procedures
```

## Common Tax Credits

### Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

**Overview**:
```
Refundable credit for low-to-moderate income workers
Designed to offset payroll taxes and incentivize work
```

**Eligibility (2024)**:
```
Must Have:
- Earned income (wages, self-employment)
- Valid Social Security Number
- US citizen or resident alien all year
- Not filing MFS (usually)
- Investment income <$11,600

Income Limits (2024):
                    No Kids  1 Kid    2 Kids   3+ Kids
Single/HOH         $18,591  $49,084  $55,768  $59,899
MFJ                $25,511  $56,004  $62,688  $66,819

Maximum Credit:
No Kids: $632
1 Kid: $4,213
2 Kids: $6,960
3+ Kids: $7,830
```

**How EITC Works**:
```
Example: Single, 1 child, $30,000 income

Phase-in (earned income × credit rate):
Up to $11,750 × 34% = max $3,995

Plateau:
$11,750 - $21,560: Full credit $3,995

Phase-out (over $21,560):
Each $1 over reduces credit by 15.98%
$30,000 - $21,560 = $8,440 over
$8,440 × 15.98% = $1,349 reduction
Credit: $3,995 - $1,349 = $2,646

Refundable: Even if tax = $0, get $2,646 refund 💰
```

**Self-Employment & EITC**:
```
Earned income includes self-employment income

But: Can elect to use prior-year income if higher
Useful if income dropped (job loss, pandemic, etc.)

Example:
2023 income: $35,000 (qualified for some EITC)
2024 income: $15,000 (qualifies for more EITC)
File 2024: Can use 2024 income for higher credit ✅
```

### Child and Dependent Care Credit

**Overview**:
```
Credit for childcare expenses while working
Non-refundable (reduces tax, not refund)
```

**Eligibility**:
```
Requirements:
- Care for child under 13 or disabled dependent
- Expenses to allow you to work (or look for work)
- Care not provided by spouse or dependent
- Care provider's ID (name, address, TIN)

Qualifying Expenses:
- Daycare
- Preschool/nursery school
- Before/after school care
- Summer day camp
- Babysitter (while working)

Not Qualifying:
- Overnight camp
- Kindergarten/first grade (education)
- Care after hours (if not working)
```

**Credit Calculation (2024)**:
```
Expense Limit:
- $3,000 for one child
- $6,000 for two or more children

Credit Rate:
- 20-35% of expenses (based on AGI)
- Higher AGI = lower %

AGI Range:
$0 - $15,000: 35%
$15,001 - $43,000: 35% phasing to 20%
$43,001+: 20%

Example:
AGI: $60,000
2 kids, daycare costs: $12,000
Expense limit: $6,000
Credit: $6,000 × 20% = $1,200

Example 2 (Lower Income):
AGI: $25,000
1 kid, daycare costs: $5,000
Expense limit: $3,000
Credit: $3,000 × 30% = $900
```

**Dependent Care FSA Interaction**:
```
If use Dependent Care FSA:
Cannot claim credit on FSA amounts

Example:
Daycare costs: $8,000
FSA contribution: $5,000
Remaining eligible: $3,000
Credit: $3,000 × 20% = $600

FSA Benefit:
$5,000 × 22% tax bracket = $1,100 tax savings
Plus $5,000 × 7.65% payroll = $383
Total FSA savings: $1,483

Credit on remaining: $600
Total benefit: $2,083

Strategy: Max FSA first ($5,000), then claim credit on remainder
```

## Estimated Quarterly Taxes

### Who Must Pay Estimated Taxes

**Requirements**:
```
Must pay if:
- Expect to owe $1,000+ in taxes AND
- Withholding < 90% of current year tax OR
- Withholding < 100% of prior year tax (110% if AGI >$150K)

Common Situations:
- Self-employed/freelance
- Side business income
- Investment income (interest, dividends, capital gains)
- Rental income
- Gig economy (Uber, DoorDash, freelance)
- No employer withholding
- Insufficient withholding

Don't Need to Pay if:
- Had no tax liability last year
- Owed <$1,000
- Withholding covers 90%+ of tax
```

### Quarterly Payment Deadlines

**Due Dates (2024 Tax Year)**:
```
Q1 (Jan 1 - Mar 31): April 15, 2024
Q2 (Apr 1 - May 31): June 17, 2024
Q3 (Jun 1 - Aug 31): September 16, 2024
Q4 (Sep 1 - Dec 31): January 15, 2025

Note: Not exactly quarterly!
Q1 = 3 months
Q2 = 2 months
Q3 = 3 months
Q4 = 4 months

Weekends/Holidays:
If due date falls on weekend/holiday, due next business day
```

**Grace Periods**:
```
No grace period! Due on due date.

But: Penalty calculation is daily
Paying late by few days = small penalty
Still pay ASAP to minimize penalty

If miss deadline:
Pay immediately
Pay remainder with tax return
Penalty will be assessed but minimized
```

### Calculating Estimated Tax Payments

**Method 1: Projected Income**:
```
1. Estimate total year income
2. Calculate expected tax
3. Subtract withholding
4. Divide by 4 (or payments remaining)

Example:
Projected income: $80,000 (wages: $50K, self-employed: $30K)
Estimated tax: $12,000
W-2 withholding: $6,000
Estimated tax needed: $6,000
Per quarter: $6,000 / 4 = $1,500

Q1: Pay $1,500 (April 15)
Q2: Pay $1,500 (June 17)
Q3: Pay $1,500 (Sept 16)
Q4: Pay $1,500 (Jan 15)
```

**Method 2: Safe Harbor (Prior Year)**:
```
Pay 100% of prior year tax (110% if AGI >$150K)
No penalty even if owe more this year

Example:
2023 tax: $10,000
2024 expected tax: $15,000 (income increased)
Safe harbor: $10,000 / 4 = $2,500 per quarter

Result:
Paid $10,000 quarterly
Owe additional $5,000 with return
No underpayment penalty ✅ (safe harbor)

High-Income Safe Harbor:
2023 AGI: $200,000
2023 tax: $40,000
Safe harbor: $40,000 × 110% = $44,000
Quarterly: $44,000 / 4 = $11,000
```

**Method 3: Annualized Income (Uneven Income)**:
```
For income that varies by quarter
Calculate each quarter separately

Example - Real Estate Agent:
Q1 income: $10,000
Q2 income: $15,000
Q3 income: $50,000 (big commission!)
Q4 income: $20,000

Annualized Method:
Q1: Pay on $10K × 4 = $40K projected
Q2: Pay on cumulative $25K × 2 = $50K projected
Q3: True-up based on $75K year-to-date
Q4: Final payment based on actual $95K

Form 2210 - AI (Annualized Income Installment)
Complex but avoids penalty on uneven income
```

### Payment Methods

**Electronic Payment (Recommended)**:
```
IRS Direct Pay:
- Free
- Directly from bank account
- irs.gov/payments
- Confirmation number
- View payment history

EFTPS (Electronic Federal Tax Payment System):
- Free
- Schedule payments in advance
- Enroll at eftps.gov
- 1-2 week enrollment period

Credit/Debit Card:

- Mail to IRS address (varies by state)
- Include SSN
- Note tax year and "2024 Form 1040-ES"
- Allow 5-7 days for delivery
- Risk of lost mail
```

### Underpayment Penalties

**How Penalty Calculated**:
```
Based on:
- Amount underpaid
- Number of days late
- Federal short-term rate + 3%
- Currently ~8% annual (varies quarterly)

Formula:
Underpayment × Daily Rate × Number of Days

Daily Rate = Annual Rate / 365
```

**Penalty Example**:
```
Required quarterly: $3,000
Actually paid: $2,000
Underpayment: $1,000

Days late: 90 days (until next payment)
Annual rate: 8%
Daily rate: 0.0219%

Penalty: $1,000 × 0.0219% × 90 = $19.71

For full year, multiply by 4 quarters
Penalties accumulate!
```

**Avoiding Penalty**:
```
Safe Harbor Rules (any one):
1. Owe <$1,000 with return
2. Paid 90% of current year tax
3. Paid 100% of prior year tax (110% if high income)

Exceptions (Waive Penalty):
- Casualty, disaster, unusual circumstances
- Retired (after age 62) or disabled
- First year self-employed
- Reasonable cause

Form 2210: Calculate and request waiver
```

### State Estimated Taxes

State rates vary:
- CA: Up to 13.3%
- NY: Up to 10.9%
- TX, FL, WA, NV, etc.: 0% (no state income tax)

Due Dates:
Usually same as federal (Apr, Jun, Sept, Jan)
Check state tax agency website

Payment Methods:
Most states have online payment systems
Usually simpler than federal
```

## Tax Planning Strategies

### Income Timing

**Deferring Income**:
```
Strategy: Push income to next year (lower tax)

When to use:
- Expect lower income next year
- Near bracket threshold
- Tax rates increasing next year (unlikely but possible)

Methods:
- Delay year-end invoicing (self-employed)
- Defer bonus to January
- Delay stock option exercise
- Installment sale (real estate)
- Deferred compensation plans

Example:
Current year: $100,000 income (24% bracket)
Next year: $75,000 projected (22% bracket)
Defer $10,000 income to next year
Tax savings: $10,000 × (24% - 22%) = $200
Plus: Time value of money (taxes paid later)
```

**Accelerating Income**:
```
Strategy: Pull income into current year

When to use:
- Expect higher income next year
- Current year has losses
- Retiring mid-next-year
- Tax rates decreasing (speculation)

Methods:
- Accelerate invoicing (self-employed)
- Request bonus in December
- Exercise stock options
- Roth conversion (if makes sense)

Example:
Current year: $40,000 (12% bracket, room to $47,150)
Next year: $100,000 (24% bracket)
Accelerate $5,000 income to current year
Fill 12% bracket instead of 24% bracket
Tax savings: $5,000 × (24% - 12%) = $600
```

### Deduction Timing

**Accelerating Deductions**:
```
Strategy: Pull deductions into current year

When to use:
- High-income year
- Itemizing this year but not next year
- Near itemization threshold

Methods:
- Prepay January mortgage payment
- Prepay property taxes (if under SALT cap)
- Bunch charitable donations (donor-advised fund)
- Make January business purchases in December
- Prepay state estimated taxes (if under SALT cap)
- Schedule medical procedures

Example:
Dec 15: Prepay Jan 1 mortgage payment ($2,000 interest)
Dec 31: Make full year charitable donation ($10,000)
Result: Extra $12,000 deductions this year instead of next
Tax savings: $12,000 × 24% = $2,880
```

**Deferring Deductions**:
```
Strategy: Push deductions to next year

When to use:
- Low-income year (won't benefit)
- Taking standard deduction this year
- Expect to itemize next year
- Higher tax bracket next year

Methods:
- Delay January purchases until January
- Delay charitable donations to January
- Wait on medical procedures

Example:
This year: Taking standard deduction ($29,200)
Extra $5,000 deduction = no benefit (wasted)

Next year: Itemizing ($35,000 currently)
Additional $5,000 = $40,000 itemized
Benefit: $5,000 × 22% = $1,100 tax savings ✅
```

### Retirement Account Strategies

**Traditional vs Roth Contributions**:
```
Traditional (Pre-Tax):
- Reduces current year taxable income
- Tax-deferred growth
- Taxed on withdrawal

Best when:
- High current tax bracket
- Expect lower bracket in retirement
- Need tax deduction now
- Maximizing current cash flow

Roth (After-Tax):
- No current deduction
- Tax-free growth
- Tax-free withdrawals (qualified)

Best when:
- Low current tax bracket
- Expect higher bracket in retirement
- Young (long growth period)
- Want tax diversification

Example:
$7,000 IRA contribution

Current bracket: 12%
Retirement bracket: 22% (expected)

Traditional:
Save now: $7,000 × 12% = $840
Pay later: $7,000 × 22% = $1,540
Net cost: -$700 (worse)

Roth:
Pay now: No deduction
Pay later: $0
Net savings: $1,540 (better!) ✅

Reverse if current bracket higher than future
```

**Last-Minute Retirement Contributions**:
```
IRA Contribution Deadline: Tax filing deadline (April 15)

Strategy: Max IRA in March if owe taxes

Example:
Preparing taxes in March
Owe $3,000

Option 1: Pay $3,000

Option 2:
Contribute $7,000 to Traditional IRA
Tax savings: $7,000 × 22% = $1,540
Owe: $3,000 - $1,540 = $1,460
Out-of-pocket: $7,000 + $1,460 = $8,460

But: Now have $7,000 in retirement (vs $3,000 to IRS)
Better long-term ✅
```

### Capital Gains Management

**Tax-Loss Harvesting**:
```
Strategy: Sell losses to offset gains

Rules:
- Capital losses offset capital gains
- $3,000 annual loss deduction against ordinary income
- Unused losses carry forward indefinitely
- Wash sale rule: Can't rebuy same security within 30 days

Example:
Stock A: +$10,000 gain
Stock B: -$4,000 loss (sell)
Net: $6,000 taxable gain
Tax savings: $4,000 × 15% = $600

Without harvesting: $10,000 × 15% = $1,500 tax
With harvesting: $6,000 × 15% = $900 tax
```

**0% Capital Gains Strategy**:
```
0% Long-Term Capital Gains Bracket:
Single: Up to $44,625 taxable income
MFJ: Up to $89,250 taxable income

Strategy: Realize gains tax-free

Example:
Retired couple, $70,000 income
Standard deduction: $29,200
Taxable income: $40,800

Room in 0% bracket: $89,250 - $40,800 = $48,450

Action: Sell stocks with $48,450 long-term gain
Capital gains tax: $0 ✅
Rebuy stocks (higher cost basis)
Future gain reduced
```

**Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS)**:
```
Section 1202: Exclude up to 100% of gain

Requirements:
- C-corporation stock
- Acquired at original issue (directly from company)
- Held >5 years
- Active business (not holding company)
- <$50M gross assets when issued

Exclusion:
- Up to greater of $10M or 10× basis

Example:
Bought startup stock: $100K
Sold after 6 years: $5M
Gain: $4.9M
QSBS exclusion: 100%
Taxable gain: $0 🎉
Tax saved: $4.9M × 20% = $980K
```

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts

**HSA (Health Savings Account)**:
```
Triple Tax Advantage:
1. Pre-tax contributions (deductible)
2. Tax-free growth
3. Tax-free withdrawals (medical)

Limits (2024):
Individual: $4,150
Family: $8,300
55+ catch-up: +$1,000

Strategy: Max HSA, invest, don't withdraw
Pay medical expenses out-of-pocket
Save receipts
Withdraw decades later (tax-free reimbursement)
After 65: Withdraw for non-medical (taxed like IRA, no penalty)

Example:
Contribute $8,300 (family)
Invest in S&P 500
Annual return: 10%
30 years: $144,500 tax-free 💰

vs. Taxable:
$8,300 × (1 - 0.24) = $6,308 after-tax to invest
30 years at 10%: $109,800
Tax on gain: ($109,800 - $6,308) × 15% = $15,524
Net: $94,276

HSA advantage: $50,224 more! ✅
```

**529 College Savings Plan**:
```
Tax-free growth for education

Contributions:
- After-tax (no federal deduction)
- Some states offer state tax deduction
- Gift tax: $18,000/year per beneficiary ($36K if married)

Withdrawals:
- Tax-free for qualified education expenses

Qualified Expenses:
- Tuition, fees, books
- Room & board (if at least half-time)
- Computers and internet
- Up to $10K per year for K-12 tuition

New (2024): Can roll $35K to Roth IRA
- If 529 open 15+ years
- Beneficiary's Roth IRA
- Subject to annual Roth IRA limits
- Great escape hatch if not used for college!
```

**Mega Backdoor Roth**:
```
Strategy: Get $40K+ into Roth IRA annually

Requirements:
- Employer 401(k) allows after-tax contributions
- Plan allows in-service withdrawals or conversions

Process:
1. Max regular 401(k): $23,000
2. Contribute after-tax: Up to $69,000 total limit
   ($69,000 - $23,000 employee - employer match)
3. Immediately convert after-tax to Roth 401(k) or rollover to Roth IRA
4. Pay tax only on earnings (if convert immediately)

Example:
Employee: $23,000 (pre-tax)
Employer match: $10,000
After-tax space: $69,000 - $33,000 = $36,000

Contribute $36,000 after-tax
Immediately convert to Roth
Result: $36,000 into Roth 401(k) 🎉
Plus: $23,000 pre-tax + $10,000 match
Total retirement: $69,000 per year!
```

### Business Tax Planning

**Section 179 Immediate Expensing**:
```
Deduct full cost of equipment immediately
(vs. depreciating over years)

Limit (2024): $1,220,000
Phase-out: Begins at $3,050,000 in purchases

Qualifying Property:
- Equipment
- Machinery
- Business vehicles (with limits)
- Computers
- Software

Strategy: Purchase equipment before Dec 31

Example:
Purchase $50,000 equipment on Dec 30
Section 179: Deduct full $50,000 in 2024
Tax bracket: 24%
Tax savings: $50,000 × 24% = $12,000

vs. Depreciation:
Year 1: $10,000 deduction = $2,400 savings
Year 2: $10,000 deduction = $2,400 savings
...
Immediate savings: $12,000 now vs. over 5 years
Time value: Earlier deduction = better
```

**Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction**:
```
Section 199A: 20% deduction for pass-through income
(Sole proprietor, partnership, S-corp)

Calculation:
20% of qualified business income
Subject to limitations (high earners, specified services)

Threshold (2024):
Single: $191,950
MFJ: $383,900

Below Threshold:
Deduct 20% of QBI, no questions

Above Threshold:
Phase-out for specified service businesses
(Doctors, lawyers, consultants, etc.)

Example:
QBI: $100,000 (below threshold)
QBI Deduction: $100,000 × 20% = $20,000
Taxable income reduced by $20,000
Tax savings: $20,000 × 24% = $4,800 ✅
```

**Retirement Plans for Self-Employed**:
```
SEP-IRA:
- Contribute up to 25% of net self-employment income
- Max: $69,000 (2024)
- Easy to set up
- Must contribute same % to eligible employees

Solo 401(k):
- Employee: $23,000 ($30,500 if 50+)
- Employer: Up to 25% of compensation
- Max total: $69,000 ($76,500 if 50+)
- Only for self-employed with no employees
- Roth option available

Example:
Self-employment income: $150,000

SEP-IRA:
$150,000 × 25% = $37,500 contribution ✅

Solo 401(k):
Employee: $23,000
Employer: $150,000 × 25% = $37,500
Total: $60,500 (more than SEP!) ✅

Tax savings: $60,500 × 24% = $14,520
```

### Family Tax Planning

**Kiddie Tax Consideration**:
```
Child's unearned income >$2,600 taxed at parent's rate

Avoid:
- Don't put investments in child's name (UTMA/UGMA)
- Unearned income taxed high

Alternative:
- 529 plan (parent-owned)
- Roth IRA (child's earned income)
- Parent's taxable account (lower capital gains)
```

**Income Splitting**:
```
Employ family members in business

Benefits:
- Shift income to lower brackets
- Legitimately reduce taxes
- Fund child's Roth IRA

Requirements:
- Legitimate work
- Reasonable compensation
- Documented (timesheets, job description)
- Actually pay them

Example:
Pay child $13,000 for genuine work
Child's tax: Standard deduction $14,600, so $0 tax ✅
Parent's savings: $13,000 × 24% = $3,120

Plus: Child contributes $7,000 to Roth IRA
Decades of tax-free growth!
```

### Charitable Giving Strategies

**Donor-Advised Fund (DAF)**:

Strategy: Bunch contributions, distribute over years

Process:
1. Contribute large amount to DAF (one year)
2. Get immediate deduction
3. Distribute to charities over years
4. DAF invests funds (grows tax-free)

Example:
Normal: $10,000/year charity for 3 years

Alternative:
Year 1: Contribute $30,000 to DAF
Years 2-3: Take standard deduction
Distribute: $10,000/year to charities from DAF

Benefit:
Year 1: Itemize $40,000 (with other deductions)
Years 2-3: Standard $29,200 each
Total: $98,400 vs. $87,600 standard (3 years)
Extra: $10,800 in deductions 💰
```

**Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)**:
```
Age 70.5+: Donate up to $105,000 from IRA to charity

Benefits:
- Counts toward RMD (73+)
- Not included in AGI (better than itemizing)
- Reduces AGI (helps other tax benefits)

vs. Standard Donation:
Take RMD: $30,000 (taxable income)
Donate: $30,000 (itemized deduction)
Net: Taxable income increased

QCD:
Donate $30,000 directly from IRA
Not included in income: $0 ✅
Satisfies RMD
AGI $30,000 lower (helps Medicare premiums, SS taxation, etc.)
```

## Conclusion

Effective tax planning requires:
1. **Understanding the basics**: Forms, deadlines, filing status
2. **Maximizing deductions**: Standard vs itemized decision
3. **Leveraging credits**: Often more valuable than deductions
4. **Estimated tax compliance**: Avoid penalties
5. **Strategic planning**: Income/deduction timing, retirement accounts

Key Principles:
- File on time (or file extension)
- Pay at least safe harbor amount (avoid penalties)
- Keep excellent records
- Maximize retirement contributions
- Consider tax-advantaged accounts (HSA, 529)
- Tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts
- Bunch deductions when near itemization threshold
- Professional help for complex situations

Remember: Tax law is complex and changes frequently. This guide provides general information, but consult a tax professional for personalized advice. The best tax strategy is the one that fits your specific situation, goals, and values. Good tax planning isn't about avoiding taxes - it's about paying what you legally owe, not a penny more.

Pro Tips:
- Start tax planning January 1, not April 1
- Review tax situation quarterly (especially if self-employed)
- Adjust W-4 withholding to avoid large refunds (interest-free loan to government)
- Keep digital copies of all tax documents (7 years minimum)
- Use tax software for simple returns, CPA for complex (business, investments, real estate)
- Stay informed on tax law changes (they happen frequently!)
