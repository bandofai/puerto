### 1.2 SWOT Analysis

**Purpose**: Assess internal capabilities and external environment

**Framework**:

**Strengths** (Internal, Positive):
- What do we do well?
- What unique resources do we have?
- What do customers see as our strengths?
- What competitive advantages do we have?

**Weaknesses** (Internal, Negative):
- What could we improve?
- Where do we lack resources?
- What do customers see as weaknesses?
- What factors lose us sales?

**Opportunities** (External, Positive):
- What market trends favor us?
- What gaps exist in the market?
- What technology changes help us?
- What regulatory changes benefit us?

**Threats** (External, Negative):
- What obstacles do we face?
- What are competitors doing?
- What technology threatens us?
- What regulatory changes hurt us?

**SWOT to Strategy Matrix**:
```
SO (Strength-Opportunity): Leverage strengths to capture opportunities
WO (Weakness-Opportunity): Overcome weaknesses to pursue opportunities
ST (Strength-Threat): Use strengths to defend against threats
WT (Weakness-Threat): Defensive strategies to minimize weaknesses and threats
```

**Best Practices**:
- Be specific (not "good brand" but "95% brand recognition in 25-34 age group")
- Prioritize (top 3-5 in each quadrant)
- Be honest about weaknesses
- Link to data where possible
- Update quarterly

### 1.3 BCG Matrix (Growth-Share Matrix)

**Purpose**: Portfolio analysis for resource allocation

**Four Quadrants**:

1. **Stars** (High Growth, High Share)
   - Market leaders in growing markets
   - Require investment to maintain position
   - Future cash cows
   - Strategy: Invest heavily

2. **Cash Cows** (Low Growth, High Share)
   - Market leaders in mature markets
   - Generate excess cash
   - Fund other ventures
   - Strategy: Harvest/maintain

3. **Question Marks** (High Growth, Low Share)
   - Small players in growing markets
   - Require cash to grow
   - Uncertain futures
   - Strategy: Invest selectively or divest

4. **Dogs** (Low Growth, Low Share)
   - Weak position in mature markets
   - Use more resources than generate
   - Strategy: Divest or reposition

**Analysis Template**:
```markdown
## BCG Matrix: [Company Portfolio]

### Stars
- [Product/Business Unit]: Market share X%, Growth rate Y%
  - Investment needed: $Z
  - Strategic priority: High
  - Timeline: 3-5 years

### Cash Cows
- [Product/Business Unit]: Market share X%, Growth rate Y%
  - Cash generation: $Z annually
  - Strategic priority: Maintain
  - Use cash for: [Stars/Question Marks]

### Question Marks
- [Product/Business Unit]: Market share X%, Growth rate Y%
  - Decision: Invest or divest
  - Investment required: $Z
  - Timeline to Star status: X years
  - Probability of success: Y%

### Dogs
- [Product/Business Unit]: Market share X%, Growth rate Y%
  - Recommendation: Divest/Reposition
  - Timeline: X months
  - Expected proceeds: $Z

## Portfolio Strategy
- Overweight in: [Quadrant]
- Underweight in: [Quadrant]
- Rebalancing actions: [List]
```

### 1.4 Ansoff Matrix (Growth Strategy)

**Purpose**: Identify growth opportunities

**Four Growth Strategies**:

1. **Market Penetration** (Existing Products, Existing Markets)
   - Increase market share
   - Increase usage by existing customers
   - Win competitors' customers
   - Risk: Low
   - Examples: Promotions, loyalty programs, better distribution

2. **Market Development** (Existing Products, New Markets)
   - New geographic markets
   - New market segments
   - New distribution channels
   - Risk: Medium
   - Examples: International expansion, B2B to B2C

3. **Product Development** (New Products, Existing Markets)
   - New features
   - New product lines
   - Innovation
   - Risk: Medium
   - Examples: Product variations, next-gen products

4. **Diversification** (New Products, New Markets)
   - Related diversification (leverage capabilities)
   - Unrelated diversification (portfolio approach)
   - Risk: High
   - Examples: New business lines, acquisitions

**Decision Framework**:
```
Start with Market Penetration (lowest risk)
↓ If market saturated
Move to Market Development or Product Development (medium risk)
↓ If core market exhausted
Consider Diversification (highest risk, highest reward)
```

### 1.5 Blue Ocean Strategy

**Purpose**: Create uncontested market space

**Key Concepts**:

**Red Ocean** (Compete in existing market):
- Compete in existing market space
- Beat the competition
- Exploit existing demand
- Value-cost trade-off

**Blue Ocean** (Create new market):
- Create uncontested market space
- Make competition irrelevant
- Create and capture new demand
- Break value-cost trade-off

**Four Actions Framework**:
```
Eliminate: What factors can be eliminated that industry has taken for granted?
Reduce: What factors can be reduced well below industry standard?
Raise: What factors should be raised well above industry standard?
Create: What factors should be created that industry has never offered?
```

**Strategy Canvas**:
- Plot your offering vs. competitors on key factors
- Identify differentiation opportunities
- Find value innovation points

**Example - Cirque du Soleil**:
- Eliminated: Star performers, animal shows, multiple rings
- Reduced: Fun and humor, thrill and danger
- Raised: Unique venues, artistic music and dance

## Part 7: Competitive Positioning

### 7.1 Generic Competitive Strategies (Porter)

**Three Generic Strategies**:

1. **Cost Leadership**
   - Be the low-cost producer
   - Compete on price
   - High volume, low margin
   - Examples: Walmart, Southwest Airlines

2. **Differentiation**
   - Offer unique value
   - Compete on features/quality
   - Premium pricing
   - Examples: Apple, Tesla

3. **Focus (Niche)**
   - Target specific segment
   - Cost focus or differentiation focus
   - Deep expertise in niche
   - Examples: Ferrari, Lululemon

**Strategic Positioning Map**:
```
         │ High Differentiation
         │
    Premium   Differentiated
    │         │
────┼─────────┼──────────► Cost
    │         │
    Mass      Low-Cost
    Market    Leader
         │
         │ Low Differentiation
```

### 7.2 Competitive Advantage Sources

**Sustainable Competitive Advantages**:

1. **Proprietary Technology**
   - Patents, trade secrets
   - Examples: Pharma drugs, Tesla batteries

2. **Network Effects**
   - Value increases with users
   - Examples: Facebook, Visa, eBay

3. **Brand / Reputation**
   - Customer loyalty, premium pricing
   - Examples: Coca-Cola, Nike

4. **Switching Costs**
   - Expensive/difficult to switch
   - Examples: SAP, Adobe Creative Suite

5. **Scale Economies**
   - Lower unit costs at scale
   - Examples: Amazon, Costco

6. **Regulatory Licenses**
   - Government-granted monopolies
   - Examples: Utilities, casinos

**Advantage Sustainability Test**:
- Is it valuable? (Does it create value?)
- Is it rare? (Do few competitors have it?)
- Is it inimitable? (Hard to copy?)
- Is it organized? (Can we exploit it?)

### 7.3 Positioning Statement

**Template**:
```
For [target customer]
Who [statement of need or opportunity]
[Product/brand name] is [product category]
That [statement of benefit]
Unlike [competitive alternative]
Our product [statement of primary differentiation]
```

**Example - Tesla**:
```
For affluent, environmentally-conscious drivers
Who want performance without compromising values
Tesla is an electric vehicle
That delivers supercar performance with zero emissions
Unlike traditional luxury cars
Tesla provides cutting-edge technology, over-the-air updates, and a sustainable ownership experience
```
