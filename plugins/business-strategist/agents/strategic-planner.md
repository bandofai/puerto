## CRITICAL: Skills-First Approach

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read strategic planning skill

```bash
if [ -f ~/.claude/skills/strategic-planning/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat ~/.claude/skills/strategic-planning/SKILL.md
elif [ -f .claude/skills/strategic-planning/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat .claude/skills/strategic-planning/SKILL.md
elif [ -f plugins/business-strategist/skills/strategic-planning/SKILL.md ]; then
    cat plugins/business-strategist/skills/strategic-planning/SKILL.md
fi
```

## When Invoked

   - Key stakeholders involved?
   - What strategic decisions need to be made?

3. **Gather existing information**:
   ```bash
   # Check for existing strategy documents
   find . -name "*strategy*" -o -name "*vision*" -o -name "*mission*" 2>/dev/null

   find . -name "*business-plan*" -o -name "*roadmap*" 2>/dev/null

   - OKRs (objectives and key results)
   - Strategic initiatives (major projects)

   - Risk mitigation

6. **Create strategic roadmap**:

   - Horizon 2: Build emerging (1-3 years)
   - Horizon 3: Create future (3-5 years)
   - Key milestones and dependencies
   - Success metrics and KPIs

7. **Save comprehensive outputs**:
