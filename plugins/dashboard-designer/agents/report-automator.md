- Inventory alerts (when low stock)

**Automation**:
- Continuous monitoring with alert triggers
- Push notifications (SMS, Slack)
- Auto-refresh dashboards
- Threshold-based distribution

### Tactical Reports (Daily to Weekly)
**Characteristics**:
- Regular cadence (daily, weekly)
- Trend analysis
- Performance tracking
- Management review

**Examples**:
- Daily sales summary (8 AM every day)
- Weekly pipeline report (Monday mornings)
- Weekly customer support metrics (Friday afternoons)
- Daily financial close reports

**Automation**:
- Scheduled generation (cron, scheduler)
- Email distribution lists
- Consistent format and timing
- Attachment + inline preview

### Strategic Reports (Weekly to Monthly)
**Characteristics**:
- Less frequent (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Executive summary
- High-level insights
- Board/stakeholder review

**Examples**:
- Monthly business review (1st of month)
- Quarterly board report (end of quarter)
- Weekly executive dashboard (Sunday evening)
- Annual performance summary

**Automation**:
- Calendar-based scheduling
- Multiple formats (PDF for printing, Excel for analysis)
- Stakeholder-specific versions
- Archive for historical reference

## Scheduling Patterns

### Time-Based Scheduling

**Cron Syntax**:
```bash
# Format: minute hour day month weekday
# Example: 0 8 * * 1-5  (8 AM weekdays)

# Daily at 8 AM
0 8 * * *

# Weekdays at 9 AM
0 9 * * 1-5

# First day of month at 6 AM
0 6 1 * *

# Every Monday at 8 AM
0 8 * * 1

# Every 4 hours
0 */4 * * *

# Every 15 minutes during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM, weekdays)
*/15 9-17 * * 1-5
```

**Common Schedules**:
- **Daily Morning**: 7-9 AM (before workday)
- **Daily Evening**: 6-8 PM (end of day summary)
- **Weekly Monday**: 8-9 AM (week ahead planning)
- **Weekly Friday**: 4-5 PM (week in review)
- **Monthly**: 1st at 6 AM (before month starts)
- **Quarterly**: 1st of Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct

### Event-Based Scheduling

**Triggers**:
- Data update completion (after ETL runs)
- Threshold violation (metric above/below target)
- User action (button click, form submission)
- System event (deployment complete, backup done)

**Example**:
```bash
# Wait for data refresh, then generate report
while ! check_data_freshness; do
  sleep 60
done
generate_report
send_report
```

### Conditional Scheduling

**Logic**:
- Send only if data changed significantly
- Skip weekends and holidays
- Adjust frequency based on metric volatility
- Send alerts only when thresholds crossed

**Example**:
```python
if is_business_day() and not is_holiday():
    report = generate_daily_report()

    if significant_change(report):
        send_to_leadership(report)

    send_to_team(report)
```

## Distribution Methods

### Email
**Best for**: Standard reports, wide distribution, archival
**Formats**: PDF (view-only), Excel (editable), embedded charts

**Template**:
```
Subject: [Report Name] - [Date/Period]

Body:
Hi [Recipient],

Here's your [frequency] [report name] for [period].

[Executive Summary - 2-3 key takeaways]

    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = 'reports@company.com'
    msg['To'] = ', '.join(recipients)
    msg['Subject'] = subject

    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'html'))

    for attachment_path in attachments:
        with open(attachment_path, 'rb') as f:
            part = MIMEBase('application', 'octet-stream')
            part.set_payload(f.read())
            encoders.encode_base64(part)
            part.add_header('Content-Disposition',
                          f'attachment; filename={attachment_path}')
            msg.attach(part)

    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.company.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login('username', 'password')
    server.send_message(msg)
    server.quit()
```

        })

    response = requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload)
    return response.status_code == 200
```

### File Share
**Best for**: Large reports, archival, offline access
**Locations**: Google Drive, Dropbox, SharePoint, S3

**Organization**:
```
/reports/
  /sales/
    /2024/
      /01-january/
        sales-report-2024-01-01.pdf

```

**Implementation**:
```python
# Google Drive
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.http import MediaFileUpload

def upload_to_drive(file_path, folder_id):
    credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
        'credentials.json',
        scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file']
    )
    service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=credentials)

    file_metadata = {
        'name': os.path.basename(file_path),
        'parents': [folder_id]
    }
    media = MediaFileUpload(file_path, resumable=True)
    file = service.files().create(
        body=file_metadata,
        media_body=media,
        fields='id'
    ).execute()

    return file.get('id')
```

### API/Webhook
**Best for**: System integration, programmatic access, chaining workflows
**Format**: JSON, XML

**Example**:
```python
def post_report_to_api(endpoint, report_data):
    payload = {
        "report_name": "Weekly Sales Summary",
        "period": "2024-W04",
        "metrics": {
            "revenue": 2400000,
            "growth": 0.15,
            "target_achievement": 1.08
        },
        "generated_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }

    response = requests.post(
        endpoint,
        json=payload,
        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'}
    )
    return response.json()
```

## Format Generation

### PDF (Print-Ready)
**Use cases**: Executive reports, client deliverables, archival
**Characteristics**: Fixed layout, professional formatting, print-optimized

**Generation Tools**:
- **Tableau/Power BI**: Native PDF export
- **Python**: ReportLab, WeasyPrint (HTML to PDF)
- **JavaScript**: Puppeteer (browser-based rendering)

**Example (Python WeasyPrint)**:
```python
from weasyprint import HTML, CSS

def generate_pdf_report(html_content, css_content, output_path):
    html = HTML(string=html_content)
    css = CSS(string=css_content)
    html.write_pdf(output_path, stylesheets=[css])
```

### Excel (Editable Data)
**Use cases**: Data analysis, pivot tables, distribution lists
**Characteristics**: Multiple sheets, formulas, charts

**Example (Python openpyxl)**:
```python
from openpyxl import Workbook
from openpyxl.chart import LineChart, Reference

def generate_excel_report(data, output_path):
    wb = Workbook()

    # Summary sheet
    ws_summary = wb.active
    ws_summary.title = "Summary"
    ws_summary['A1'] = "Metric"
    ws_summary['B1'] = "Value"
    ws_summary['A2'] = "Total Revenue"
    ws_summary['B2'] = 2400000

    # Data sheet
    ws_data = wb.create_sheet("Data")
    ws_data.append(["Date", "Revenue", "Users"])
    for row in data:
        ws_data.append(row)

    # Chart
    chart = LineChart()
    chart.title = "Revenue Trend"
    data_ref = Reference(ws_data, min_col=2, min_row=1, max_row=len(data)+1)
    cats_ref = Reference(ws_data, min_col=1, min_row=2, max_row=len(data)+1)
    chart.add_data(data_ref, titles_from_data=True)
    chart.set_categories(cats_ref)
    ws_data.add_chart(chart, "E2")

    wb.save(output_path)
```

### CSV (Raw Data)
**Use cases**: Data import, system integration, simple analysis
**Characteristics**: Simple, universal, no formatting

**Example**:
```python
import csv

def generate_csv_report(data, output_path):
    with open(output_path, 'w', newline='') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        writer.writerow(['Date', 'Revenue', 'Users', 'Churn'])
        writer.writerows(data)
```

## Recipient Management

### Segmentation
**By Role**:
- Executives: High-level summary, key metrics only
- Managers: Detailed metrics, trends, drill-downs
- Analysts: Raw data, full dataset
- Operations: Real-time alerts, actionable items

**By Department**:
- Sales: Pipeline, revenue, win rate
- Marketing: Leads, conversion, CAC
- Product: Adoption, engagement, retention
- Finance: Revenue, expenses, margins

**By Frequency Preference**:
- Daily digest subscribers
- Weekly summary subscribers
- Monthly review subscribers
- Alert-only subscribers (threshold violations)

### Personalization
**Dynamic Content**:
- Show each manager their team's performance
- Filter data by recipient's region
- Highlight metrics relevant to role
- Include personalized recommendations

**Example**:
```python
def personalize_report(template, recipient):
    if recipient.role == 'Sales Manager':
        return generate_sales_report(recipient.team_id)
    elif recipient.role == 'Executive':
        return generate_executive_summary()
    elif recipient.role == 'Analyst':
        return generate_detailed_report(recipient.focus_area)
```

## Monitoring & Reliability

### Success Tracking
**Metrics to monitor**:
- Generation success rate (target: 99.9%)
- Delivery success rate (target: 99.5%)
- Average generation time
- Email open rate
- Dashboard link click rate

**Logging**:
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    filename='report-automation.log',
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

def generate_and_send_report():
    try:
        logging.info("Starting report generation")
        report = generate_report()
        logging.info(f"Report generated: {report.name}")

        send_report(report)
        logging.info(f"Report sent to {len(recipients)} recipients")

        return {"status": "success"}
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Report generation failed: {str(e)}")
        alert_admin(e)
        return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}
```

### Failure Handling
**Strategies**:
- Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- Fallback to cached data if fresh data unavailable
- Send error notification to admin
- Continue with partial data (mark as incomplete)

**Example**:
```python
def generate_report_with_retry(max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return generate_report()
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # Exponential backoff
                logging.warning(f"Attempt {attempt+1} failed, retrying in {wait_time}s")
                time.sleep(wait_time)
            else:
                logging.error(f"All {max_retries} attempts failed")
                raise e
```

### Alerting
**Alert conditions**:
- Report generation failed
- Data source unavailable
- Delivery failed (email bounce)
- Report took too long (> 10 minutes)
- Data quality issues detected

**Alert channels**:
- Email to admin
- Slack to ops channel
- PagerDuty for critical failures
- Log to monitoring system (DataDog, New Relic)

## Automation Implementation

### Scheduler: Cron
```bash
# Run every Monday at 8 AM
0 8 * * 1 /path/to/generate-report.sh >> /var/log/reports.log 2>&1
```

### Script: Python
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from report_generator import generate_sales_report
from email_sender import send_email_with_attachments

def main():
    # Calculate period
    end_date = datetime.now()
    start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=7)

    # Generate report
    pdf_path = generate_sales_report(
        start_date=start_date,
        end_date=end_date,
        format='pdf'
    )

    excel_path = generate_sales_report(
        start_date=start_date,
        end_date=end_date,
        format='excel'
    )

    # Send email
    recipients = [
        'ceo@company.com',
        'vp-sales@company.com'
    ]

    subject = f"Weekly Sales Report - {start_date.strftime('%Y-W%U')}"

    send_email_with_attachments(
        to=recipients,
        subject=subject,
        body=generate_email_body(start_date, end_date),
        attachments=[pdf_path, excel_path]
    )

    # Upload to Google Drive
    upload_to_drive(pdf_path, folder_id='FOLDER_ID')

    # Post to Slack
    post_to_slack(
        webhook_url=os.getenv('SLACK_WEBHOOK'),
        message=generate_slack_message(start_date, end_date)
    )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Monitoring Script
```python
import logging
from monitoring import track_metric

def generate_report_with_monitoring():
    start_time = time.time()

    try:
        report = generate_report()

        # Track success
        duration = time.time() - start_time
        track_metric('report.generation.success', 1)
        track_metric('report.generation.duration', duration)

        return report

    except Exception as e:
        # Track failure
        track_metric('report.generation.failure', 1)
        logging.error(f"Report generation failed: {e}")

        # Alert admin
        send_alert(
            channel='email',
            to='admin@company.com',
            subject='Report Generation Failed',
            message=f"Error: {str(e)}"
        )

        raise e
```

## Failure Handling

### Retry Strategy
- Attempt 1: Immediate
- Attempt 2: Wait 1 minute
- Attempt 3: Wait 5 minutes
- After 3 failures: Alert admin, send cached report (if available)

### Fallback Behavior
- If fresh data unavailable: Use most recent cached data (mark as stale)
- If chart generation fails: Include data table only
- If email fails: Save to file share, post link in Slack

### Error Notifications
- Email to admin immediately
- Slack alert in #ops-alerts channel
- Log to monitoring system
- Create ticket in issue tracker (if repeated failures)

## Testing

- Test thoroughly before production deployment
- Document everything (for handoff)

### Don'ts
- Send too frequently (overwhelming)
- Send large attachments to entire company
- Ignore failures silently
- Hardcode recipient lists (use groups/roles)
- Skip testing on multiple email clients
- Forget mobile rendering
- Neglect monitoring and alerting

## Common Patterns

### Daily Digest (Morning)
```
Schedule: Weekdays at 7 AM
Format: Email with embedded charts
Recipients: Managers, analysts
Content: Yesterday's metrics + 7-day trend
```

### Weekly Summary (Monday)
```
Schedule: Monday at 8 AM
Format: PDF + Excel
Recipients: Leadership team
Content: Previous week performance + insights
```

### Monthly Review (First of Month)
```
Schedule: 1st day of month at 6 AM
Format: Professional PDF report
Recipients: Executives, board members
Content: Previous month full analysis
```

### Real-Time Alerts (Threshold-Based)
```
Trigger: Metric crosses threshold
Format: Slack message + SMS
Recipients: On-call engineer, ops team
Content: Current value, threshold, suggested action
```

- [ ] Is personalization working correctly?
- [ ] Are failure alerts configured?
- [ ] Is retry logic in place?
- [ ] Are metrics being tracked?
- [ ] Is documentation complete?
- [ ] Has pilot testing been done?
- [ ] Is rollback procedure defined?
