## When Invoked

1. **Read the skill**: Load dashboard-design skill for comprehensive KPI frameworks
2. **Understand business context**: What are the business goals, stage, industry?
3. **Identify dashboard type**: Operational, tactical, or strategic?
4. **Apply framework**: Choose North Star Metric, AARRR, balanced scorecard, or OKRs
5. **Select KPIs**: Pick metrics that are SMART and actionable
6. **Define hierarchy**: Primary (North Star) → supporting → operational metrics
7. **Document metrics**: Formula, data source, target, owner, update frequency
8. **Validate selection**: Check for leading/lagging balance, avoid vanity metrics

## KPI Selection Process

### Step 1: Business Context Analysis
Ask critical questions:
- What is the primary business objective? (Growth, profitability, efficiency)
- What stage is the company? (Startup, growth, mature)
- What industry? (SaaS, e-commerce, marketplace, B2B, media)
- Who is the audience? (Executive, manager, analyst, operations)
- What decisions will these metrics inform?

### Step 2: Framework Selection

**Choose North Star Metric when**:
- Need single unifying metric
- Want to align entire company
- Early-stage startup finding product-market fit

**Choose AARRR when**:
- Consumer product or SaaS
- Focus on growth funnel
- Want to identify bottlenecks in user journey

**Choose Balanced Scorecard when**:
- Mature organization
- Need multiple perspectives (financial, customer, process, learning)
- Strategic planning focus

**Choose OKRs when**:
- Goal-setting and execution
- Quarterly planning cycles
- Need ambitious, measurable outcomes

### Step 3: Metric Selection Criteria

**SMART Validation**:
- Specific: Is it clearly defined?
- Measurable: Can you quantify it?
- Achievable: Is it realistic?
- Relevant: Does it align with goals?
- Time-bound: What's the timeframe?

**Leading vs. Lagging**:
- Lagging: Revenue, churn, NPS (outcomes, historical)
- Leading: Pipeline, trial signups, engagement (predictive, actionable)
- Balance: Include both types

**Avoid Vanity Metrics**:
- Total users (use active users instead)
- Page views (use engagement time instead)
- Social followers (use engagement rate instead)
- Registered users (use activated users instead)

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Start with business objective, work backward to metrics
- Choose 1 North Star Metric, 5-7 supporting KPIs
- Include both leading and lagging indicators
- Define metrics clearly (formula, source, owner)
- Set specific targets with red/yellow/green thresholds
- Review and adjust metrics quarterly

### Don'ts
- Select too many KPIs (dashboard overwhelm)
- Choose vanity metrics (total users, page views)
- Ignore data availability (can't measure, don't choose)
- Pick metrics without targets
- Use ambiguous definitions
- Set and forget (metrics evolve with business)

## Common Patterns by Industry

### E-Commerce
- North Star: Orders per Active Customer
- Supporting: Conversion rate, AOV, cart abandonment, repeat purchase rate

### Marketplace
- North Star: Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)
- Supporting: Take rate, buyer/seller ratio, transactions, liquidity

### SaaS
- North Star: Weekly Active Users Completing Core Action
- Supporting: MRR, churn, NPS, feature adoption, trial conversion

### Media/Content
- North Star: Time Spent Consuming Content
- Supporting: DAU/MAU, content consumption rate, sharing rate, ad revenue

### B2B
- North Star: Active Users in Paying Accounts
- Supporting: ARR, logo retention, expansion revenue, NPS
