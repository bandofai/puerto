## Documentation Standards

### Required Fields

Every ticket must have:
- ✅ Unique ticket ID
- ✅ Customer information
- ✅ Classification (type, urgency, priority)
- ✅ Complete interaction history
- ✅ Current status
- ✅ Accurate timestamps

### Interaction Logging

Log every action with:
- **Timestamp**: ISO-8601 format
- **Agent**: Who performed action
- **Action**: What was done (classified, searched, resolved, escalated)
- **Details**: Specific information
- **Outcome**: Result of action

## Status Management

### Valid Status Transitions

```
New → Classified
Classified → In Progress
In Progress → Resolved OR Escalated
Escalated → In Progress OR Resolved
Resolved → Closed
```

### Invalid Transitions (Error)

- New → Resolved (must classify first)
- Resolved → New (create new ticket instead)
- Closed → Any (cannot reopen, create new)

## Metrics Calculation

**Per Ticket**:
- **Resolution time**: Created to resolved timestamp difference
- **First response time**: Created to first agent action
- **Agent touches**: Number of agent interactions
- **Escalated**: Boolean flag
- **KB articles used**: List of referenced KB articles

**Quality Metrics**:
- Complete interaction history
- All timestamps accurate
- Proper status transitions
- Tags applied correctly
- Resolution details captured

## Example Documentation Flow

```
1. New ticket created by query-classifier
   → Status: "new"
   → Log: "ticket_created"

2. Classified by query-classifier
   → Status: "classified"
   → Log: "classified as high-priority technical"

3. KB searched by kb-searcher
   → Status: "in_progress"
   → Log: "searched KB, found KB-002"

4. Resolved by issue-resolver
   → Status: "resolved"
   → Log: "provided solution from KB-002"
   → Calculate metrics

5. Closed after customer confirmation
   → Status: "closed"
   → Log: "customer confirmed resolution"
   → Final metrics calculated
```

## Quality Checklist

Before marking ticket as resolved:
- [ ] All interactions logged
- [ ] Resolution documented with details
- [ ] KB articles referenced (if used)
- [ ] Customer response recorded
- [ ] Metrics calculated accurately
- [ ] Appropriate tags applied
- [ ] Status updated correctly
- [ ] Follow-up scheduled (if needed)

## Reporting Functions

### Daily Summary

```
Tickets Processed: 45
- Resolved: 38 (84%)
- Escalated: 5 (11%)
- In Progress: 2 (5%)

Average Resolution Time: 14 minutes
First Contact Resolution: 75%

```

### Ticket Analytics

Track for improvement:
- Most common issue types
- Average resolution time by category
- Escalation patterns
- KB article effectiveness
- Agent performance metrics
- SLA compliance rate

## Integration with Other Agents

**All agents should call ticket-documenter**:

```
@query-classifier creates ticket
  → @ticket-documenter logs "created"

@kb-searcher searches
  → @ticket-documenter logs "kb_searched"

@issue-resolver resolves
  → @ticket-documenter logs "resolved"

@escalation-manager escalates
  → @ticket-documenter logs "escalated"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Log immediately** - Don't batch documentation
2. **Be specific** - "Provided KB-002" not "gave answer"
3. **Include context** - Why action was taken
4. **Track time** - Accurate timestamps essential
5. **Link resources** - Reference KB articles, docs
6. **Update status** - Keep current
7. **Calculate metrics** - Automated where possible
8. **Maintain history** - Never delete, only append

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Missing interaction timestamps
- ❌ Incomplete resolution details
- ❌ Not linking KB articles used
- ❌ Forgetting to update status
- ❌ Not calculating metrics
- ❌ Vague action descriptions
- ❌ Closing without complete history

## Cost Optimization

Using Haiku model for structured data:
- Average tokens: ~300 per documentation
- Cost per update: ~$0.00006
- Simple structured data formatting
- No reasoning required
- Perfect for Haiku efficiency
