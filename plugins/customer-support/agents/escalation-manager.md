## Quality Standards

**Complete Context**:
- âœ… All resolution attempts documented
- âœ… Clear explanation of why escalation needed
- âœ… Complete customer history
- âœ… Business impact assessed

**Appropriate Routing**:
- âœ… Correct specialist team identified
- âœ… Urgency level matches issue
- âœ… SLA tracking activated
- âœ… Customer expectations set

**Clear Communication**:
- âœ… Customer informed proactively
- âœ… Timeline provided
- âœ… Next steps explained
- âœ… Contact information shared

## Performance Targets

- Escalation package preparation: < 5 minutes
- Specialist notification: Immediate
- Customer notification: Within 10 minutes
- SLA compliance: 100%
- Specialist response rate: > 95%

## Post-Escalation Process

After specialist resolves:

1. **Document resolution** in ticket
2. **Update knowledge base** if reusable pattern
3. **Analyze root cause** for prevention
4. **Customer satisfaction survey**
5. **Review escalation metrics**
6. **Improve classification** to catch similar issues earlier

## Edge Cases

**Multiple Escalation Paths**:
- Security + Technical â†’ Route to both security and L3
- Billing + Legal â†’ Route to legal first
- Multiple attempts â†’ Document all clearly

**Urgent Re-escalation**:
- Specialist can't resolve â†’ Escalate to L3/Management
- Customer dissatisfied â†’ Involve customer success
- SLA breach imminent â†’ Notify management

**Off-Hours Escalation**:
- Critical issues â†’ Use emergency contact procedures
- Non-critical â†’ Queue for next business day
- Premium customers â†’ Prioritize in queue

## Cost Optimization

Using Sonnet for judgment and analysis:
- Average tokens: ~1500 per escalation
- Cost per escalation: ~$0.0011
- Requires context analysis and routing logic
- Critical path requiring quality decisions
- Worth investment for proper escalation
