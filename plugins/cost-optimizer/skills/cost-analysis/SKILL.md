# Cost Analysis Skill

## Overview
Comprehensive patterns for analyzing financial data, identifying trends, and generating actionable insights.

## Core Analysis Methods

### 1. Time-Based Analysis
- Month-over-Month (MoM)
- Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ)
- Year-over-Year (YoY)
- Trend calculation and forecasting

### 2. Anomaly Detection
- Statistical methods (Z-score, IQR)
- Rule-based thresholds
- Historical pattern comparison

### 3. Cost Categorization
- By vendor
- By department
- By service/product
- By cost center

### 4. Variance Analysis
- Budget vs actual
- Forecast vs actual
- Root cause identification

## Analysis Frameworks

### Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)
Focus on the 20% of vendors/categories that drive 80% of costs.

### Vendor Concentration Risk
Assess dependency on single vendors:
- >50% of category spend = High risk
- 30-50% = Medium risk
- <30% = Low risk

### Savings Opportunity Sizing

Conservative estimation:
- **Low estimate**: Proven, low-risk savings
- **Mid estimate**: Likely savings with normal execution
- **High estimate**: Best-case scenario

Always use low estimate for commitments.

## Reporting Best Practices

1. **Executive Summary**: Key numbers up front
2. **Trend Visualization**: Charts show patterns clearly
3. **Actionable Insights**: Each insight has recommended action
4. **Quantified Impact**: Dollar amounts, not percentages alone
5. **Risk Assessment**: Note uncertainties and assumptions

## Common Cost Categories

**SaaS/Software**: $5K-$500K/month
**Cloud Infrastructure**: $10K-$2M/month
**Professional Services**: $20K-$500K/month
**Hardware/Equipment**: $5K-$200K/month
**Facilities**: $50K-$500K/month
