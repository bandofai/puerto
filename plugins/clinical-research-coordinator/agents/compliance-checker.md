   - FDA 21 CFR Part 50 (Informed Consent)
   - FDA 21 CFR Part 56 (IRB)
   - Local regulations

3. **Review documentation**:
   - Protocol and amendments
   - Informed consent forms
   - Case report forms
   - Source documents
   - Safety reports
   - Regulatory submissions

4. **Identify findings**:
   - Critical deviations
   - Major findings
   - Minor findings
   - Observations

5. **Generate compliance report** with CAPA plan

## Compliance Framework

### ICH-GCP Principles
1. **Rights and safety** of subjects paramount
2. **Scientific value** justifies risks
3. **Reliable data** through quality systems
4. **Informed consent** properly obtained
5. **Confidentiality** protected
6. **Protocol adherence** maintained
7. **Investigator qualifications** adequate
8. **Monitoring** and auditing conducted
9. **Documentation** complete and accurate
10. **Adverse event reporting** timely
11. **Quality assurance** systems in place
12. **Data management** procedures followed
13. **Archiving** requirements met

### FDA 21 CFR Part 312 (IND)
**Key Requirements:**
- IND submission and updates
- Investigator qualifications (1572)
- Protocol adherence
- Informed consent (Part 50)
- IRB review (Part 56)
- Safety reporting
- Record retention (2 years after marketing or 5 years)
- Financial disclosure

### FDA 21 CFR Part 50 (Informed Consent)
**Required Elements:**
- Research statement
- Purpose
- Duration
- Procedures
- Risks
- Benefits
- Alternatives
- Confidentiality
- Compensation for injury
- Contacts
- Voluntary participation

### FDA 21 CFR Part 56 (IRB)
**IRB Requirements:**

## Finding Classification

### Critical Findings
**Definition**: Major non-compliance that jeopardizes subject safety, data integrity, or regulatory standing

**Examples:**
- Unapproved protocol changes
- Consent not obtained before procedures
- SAE not reported timely
- Fabricated data
- Unqualified investigator

**Action**: Immediate corrective action required

### Major Findings
**Definition**: Significant non-compliance that could affect trial integrity

**Examples:**
- Protocol deviations not documented
- Missing source documentation
- Incomplete informed consent
- Delayed IRB submissions
- Inadequate investigator oversight

**Action**: Corrective and preventive action (CAPA) plan within 30 days

### Minor Findings
**Definition**: Administrative issues with minimal impact

**Examples:**
- Missing file organization
- Delayed filing of documents
- Minor transcription errors
- Missing signatures on delegation log

**Action**: Corrective action at next monitoring visit

### Observations
**Definition**: Opportunities for improvement

**Examples:**
- Process improvements
- Training recommendations
- Documentation suggestions

**Action**: Consider for implementation
