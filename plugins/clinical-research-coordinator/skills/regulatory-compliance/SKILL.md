# Regulatory Compliance Skill

Comprehensive regulatory frameworks for clinical trial compliance including ICH-GCP, FDA regulations, IRB requirements, and international standards.

## ICH-GCP Compliance Framework

### Overview
**ICH-GCP (International Council for Harmonisation - Good Clinical Practice)** is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting trials involving human subjects.

**Purpose**:
- Protect rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects
- Ensure reliability and accuracy of clinical trial data
- Provide common standards for EU, Japan, US, and other countries

### ICH-GCP Structure

**13 Main Sections**:
1. Glossary
2. The Principles of ICH-GCP
3. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC)
4. Investigator
5. Sponsor
6. Clinical Trial Protocol and Protocol Amendment(s)
7. Investigator's Brochure
8. Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial

### 13 Principles of ICH-GCP

**Principle 1 - Subject Protection**
Clinical trials should be conducted in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and are consistent with GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.

**Principle 2 - Risk-Benefit**
Before a trial is initiated, foreseeable risks and inconveniences should be weighed against the anticipated benefit for the individual trial subject and society. A trial should be initiated and continued only if the anticipated benefits justify the risks.

**Principle 3 - Subject Rights**
The rights, safety, and well-being of the trial subjects are the most important considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society.

**Principle 4 - Safety Information**
The available nonclinical and clinical information on an investigational product should be adequate to support the proposed clinical trial.

**Principle 5 - Protocol Compliance**
Clinical trials should be scientifically sound, and described in a clear, detailed protocol.

**Principle 6 - Ethics Committee**
A trial should be conducted in compliance with the protocol that has received prior institutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC) approval/favorable opinion.

**Principle 7 - Medical Care**
The medical care given to, and medical decisions made on behalf of, subjects should always be the responsibility of a qualified physician or, when appropriate, of a qualified dentist.

**Principle 8 - Qualified Personnel**
Each individual involved in conducting a trial should be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform his or her respective task(s).

**Principle 9 - Informed Consent**
Freely given informed consent should be obtained from every subject prior to clinical trial participation.

**Principle 10 - Data Integrity**
All clinical trial information should be recorded, handled, and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, interpretation, and verification.

**Principle 11 - Confidentiality**
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects should be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.

**Principle 12 - GMP**
Investigational products should be manufactured, handled, and stored in accordance with applicable good manufacturing practice (GMP). They should be used in accordance with the approved protocol.

**Principle 13 - Quality Systems**
Systems with procedures that assure the quality of every aspect of the trial should be implemented.
