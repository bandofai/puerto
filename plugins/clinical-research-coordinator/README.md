## Workflow Examples

### Complete Protocol Development
```bash
# 1. Design protocol
Use protocol-designer to create Phase II protocol for Drug X in Type 2 Diabetes.
Target: 200 subjects, primary endpoint HbA1c reduction at 12 weeks.
Randomized 1:1 to Drug X vs placebo, double-blind.

# 2. Plan recruitment
Use enrollment-manager to plan recruitment strategy.
Target enrollment: 200 subjects over 12 months across 20 sites.
Analyze feasibility and identify potential barriers.

# 3. Setup compliance framework
Use compliance-checker to verify essential documents complete
before study initiation. ICH-GCP and FDA 21 CFR compliance.
```

### Adverse Event Management
```bash
# Patient reports severe nausea and vomiting
