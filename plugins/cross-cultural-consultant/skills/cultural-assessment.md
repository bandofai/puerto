### Cultural Distance Analysis

#### Cultural Distance Matrix
Measures "distance" between cultures on each dimension.

```
Example: US (Individualist) vs Japan (Collectivist)

Dimension          | US Score | Japan Score | Distance | Significance
-------------------|----------|-------------|----------|-------------
Power Distance     | 40       | 54          | 14       | Low
Individualism      | 91       | 46          | 45       | HIGH
Masculinity        | 62       | 95          | 33       | High
Uncertainty Avoid  | 46       | 92          | 46       | HIGH
Long-term Orient   | 26       | 88          | 62       | HIGH
Indulgence         | 68       | 42          | 26       | Medium

Overall Distance: HIGH (requires significant cultural adaptation)
```

#### Interpretation Guidelines

**Distance Score**
