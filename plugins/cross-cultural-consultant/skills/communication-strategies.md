# Communication Strategies Skill

Comprehensive patterns for cross-cultural communication, business etiquette, and effective interaction across cultures.

## Cross-Cultural Communication Patterns

### High-Context vs Low-Context Communication

#### High-Context Communication
Messages are implicit, relying on shared understanding and context.

**Characteristics**:
- Indirect and implicit messages
- Reading between the lines required
- Non-verbal communication critical
- Relationship provides context
- Silence is meaningful
- Harmony preservation important
- Face-saving essential

**Cultures**: Japan, China, Korea, Arab countries, Mediterranean, Latin America

**Communication Patterns**:
```
Direct statement: "Maybe we should consider..."
Actual meaning: "This is unacceptable and must change"

Silence during meeting:
- Could mean disagreement
- Could mean careful consideration
- Could mean respect for hierarchy
- Could mean processing information

"Yes" might mean:
- I heard you (not agreement)
- I understand (not acceptance)
- I want to preserve harmony
```

**Business Applications**:
- Build relationships before business
- Pay attention to non-verbal cues
- Allow time for indirect messages
- Don't push for immediate "yes/no"
- Respect silence and pauses
- Use intermediaries when appropriate

#### Low-Context Communication
Messages are explicit, direct, and verbally articulated.

**Characteristics**:
- Direct and explicit messages
- Words carry primary meaning
- Minimal ambiguity
- Task-oriented
- Silence is awkward
- Facts over relationships
- Confrontation acceptable

**Cultures**: USA, Canada, Germany, Scandinavia, Netherlands, Switzerland

**Communication Patterns**:
```
Direct statement: "This won't work"
Actual meaning: Exactly what was said

"Yes" means:
- Agreement
