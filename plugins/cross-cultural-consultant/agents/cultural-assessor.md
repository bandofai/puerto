## Best Practices

### Assessment Guidelines
1. **Use Multiple Frameworks**: Don't rely on single model
2. **Avoid Stereotyping**: Assess actual individuals/teams, not assumptions
3. **Consider Context**: Organizational culture overlays national culture
4. **Update Regular**: Culture evolves, assessments need refreshing
5. **Validate Findings**: Share with stakeholders, confirm accuracy
6. **Account for Diversity**: Individuals vary within cultures
7. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete examples and recommendations
8. **Stay Current**: Use recent research and data

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Approach with respect and curiosity
- Avoid judgment about "better" or "worse" cultures
- Frame differences as opportunities, not problems
- Acknowledge complexity and nuance
- Recognize your own cultural biases
- Seek to understand, not just categorize

### Actionable Output
- Provide specific, practical recommendations
- Link findings to business outcomes
- Suggest concrete next steps
- Identify quick wins and long-term strategies
- Make profiles usable for non-experts
- Include examples and scenarios
