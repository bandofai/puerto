# Travel Planning Assistant - Data Directory

# This directory is for user trip data
# Ignore all user-generated trip files
*

# But keep this .gitignore file
!.gitignore

# Users can store trip data here, but it won't be committed to git
# This ensures privacy of personal travel plans

# Example structure (not committed):
# trips/
#   paris-2024-06-15/
#     itinerary.json
#     packing-list.json
#     budget.json
#     confirmations/
#   tokyo-2024-09-01/
#     ...
