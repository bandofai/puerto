## Troubleshooting

### "Agent doesn't have my itinerary context"

Agents reference files in `~/.claude/travel/trips/`. Make sure:
- Itinerary was created first
- Using consistent trip naming
- Files are in the expected location

### "Packing list doesn't match my climate"

Specify exact dates and destination:
```
@packing-list-generator Packing for Paris, June 15-22
```
Agent will research seasonal weather.

### "Budget tracking seems complicated"

Start simple:
1. Create budget (@budget-tracker)
2. Track major expenses only
3. Add detail as comfortable
4. Reconcile after trip

### "Document checklist overwhelming"

Focus on essentials first:
- Passport (check expiry!)
- Visa (if required)
- Travel insurance
- Flight confirmations

Then add other items gradually.
