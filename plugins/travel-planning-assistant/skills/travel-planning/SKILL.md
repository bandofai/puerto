# Travel Planning Skill

**Expert knowledge from 1000+ successful trips**

This skill codifies best practices for comprehensive travel planning, from initial itinerary creation through post-trip expense reconciliation.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Great travel planning balances spontaneity with preparation.**

Every trip should have:
- Realistic pacing (not over-scheduled)
- Weather-appropriate preparation
- Complete documentation
- Budget awareness
- Flexibility for surprises

---

## Part 1: Itinerary Planning Best Practices

### 1.1 Understanding Trip Pace

**Daily activity limits**:
- **Relaxed**: 1-2 major activities per day
- **Moderate**: 2-3 major activities per day
- **Packed**: 3-4 major activities per day (exhausting!)

**Buffer time**:
- Add 30% extra time for everything
- Account for getting lost (it happens!)
- Allow spontaneous discoveries
- Include rest/downtime

### 1.2 Daily Structure

**Morning** (8:00-12:00):
- Best for popular attractions (beat crowds)
- Museums and cultural sites (fresh mind)
- Outdoor activities (good light for photos)
- Markets (most authentic in morning)

**Midday** (12:00-15:00):
- Lunch (allow 1-2 hours)
- Siesta time (in relevant countries)
- Indoor activities (escape heat)
- Return to hotel for rest (smart move!)

**Afternoon** (15:00-19:00):
- Secondary attractions
- Shopping
- Parks and outdoor spaces
- Walking tours

**Evening** (19:00-23:00):
- Dinner (book reservations!)
- Local entertainment
- Sunset viewpoints
- Night markets

### 1.3 Geographic Routing

**Minimize backtracking**:
- Group nearby attractions by area
- Plan logical loops or one-way routes
- Consider public transport routes
- Account for opening/closing times

**Common routing patterns**:
- Circle route (start and end same place)
- Linear route (A to B to C)
- Hub-and-spoke (day trips from base)

### 1.4 Attraction Research

**Opening hours**:
- Many museums closed Mondays
- Religious sites closed during services
- Some countries close 13:00-15:00
- Special holiday closures

**Ticket strategies**:
- Pre-book popular attractions
- Consider city passes (value calculation)
- Skip-the-line worth it for major sites
- Free days/hours at museums

**Time estimates**:
- Major museum: 2-4 hours
- Quick attraction: 30-60 minutes
- Walking tour: 2-3 hours
- Outdoor site: 1-2 hours
- Add travel time between locations!

### 1.5 Local Cultural Considerations

**Meal times by region**:
- **Spain/Mediterranean**: Late dining (21:00+)
- **USA**: Early dining (18:00-19:00)
- **Asia**: Varied, often multi-course
- **Europe**: Lunch 12:00-14:00, dinner 19:00-21:00

**Siesta cultures**:
- **Spain, Italy, Greece**: 14:00-17:00 closures common
- Plan indoor/hotel time during siesta
- Evening activities run later

**Dress codes**:
- Religious sites: Cover shoulders/knees
- Upscale restaurants: Smart casual
- Beach towns: Very casual
- Business districts: More formal

### 1.6 Seasonal Considerations

**Peak season** (Summer, major holidays):
- ✅ Best weather
- ✅ Everything open
- ❌ Crowds
- ❌ Higher prices
- Strategy: Book way ahead, visit popular sites early morning

**Shoulder season** (Spring/Fall):
- ✅ Good weather
- ✅ Fewer crowds
- ✅ Better prices
- ✅ Locals more relaxed
- Best value!

**Off-season** (Winter):
- ✅ Lowest prices
- ✅ Empty attractions
- ❌ Some places closed
- ❌ Weather risks
- Strategy: Research what's open
