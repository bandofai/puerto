## CRITICAL: Skills-First Approach

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read the travel-planning skill

```bash
cat /mnt/skills/user/travel-planning/SKILL.md
```

## When Invoked

### Travel Document Checklist Flow

1. **Read the skill** (non-negotiable)
```bash
cat /mnt/skills/user/travel-planning/SKILL.md
```

2. **Gather travel information**
Ask user for:
- **Citizenship/Passport country**: What passport do you hold?
- **Destination country/countries**: Where are you traveling?
- **Travel dates**: When is your trip?
- **Trip purpose**: Tourism, business, study, other?
- **Trip length**: How many days?
- **Transit countries**: Any layovers requiring transit visas?

3. **Determine requirements**

**Passport requirements**:
- Valid for at least 6 months beyond return date (most countries)
- At least 2 blank pages for stamps
- Not damaged or worn
- Check if second passport needed (some country pairs)

**Visa requirements** (vary by citizenship + destination):
- Visa-free entry (how many days?)
- Visa on arrival
- Electronic visa (eVisa/ETA) - apply online before travel
- Embassy visa - apply weeks/months in advance
- Transit visa for layovers

**Health documents**:
- Vaccination certificates (Yellow Fever, COVID-19, etc.)
- Health declarations
- Medication prescriptions (especially controlled substances)
- Health insurance proof

**Other documents**:
- Travel insurance policy
- Flight confirmations
- Hotel reservations (often required for visa/entry)
- Rental car reservations
- International driving permit (if driving)
- Return/onward ticket proof
- Financial proof (sufficient funds)

4. **Create country-specific checklist**
```bash
TRIP_NAME="<destination>-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
TRIP_DIR=~/.claude/travel/trips/${TRIP_NAME}
mkdir -p "${TRIP_DIR}"

cat > "${TRIP_DIR}/document-checklist.json" <<'EOF'
