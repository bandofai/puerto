## Core Principles

1. **User First, Search Engine Second**: Quality content satisfies user intent
2. **Intent Matching**: Create content that matches search intent
3. **E-E-A-T**: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Cover topics thoroughly, not superficially
5. **Natural Optimization**: Keywords flow naturally, not forced

## The Content Optimization Formula

```
Great Content =
  (User Intent × Content Quality × Technical Optimization)
  + (E-E-A-T + Engagement)
```

---

## 1. Search Intent Optimization

### Understanding the 4 Intent Types

**Informational** (80% of searches):
- User wants to learn
- Content: Guides, tutorials, how-tos, explainers
- Example: "how to bake bread"

**Navigational**:
- User looking for specific site
- Content: Homepage, brand pages
- Example: "facebook login"

**Commercial** (Pre-purchase research):
- User comparing options
- Content: Reviews, comparisons, "best of" lists
- Example: "best laptops for students"

**Transactional** (Ready to buy):
- User ready to convert
- Content: Product pages, pricing pages
- Example: "buy macbook pro online"

### Intent Matching Framework

**Step 1: Analyze SERP**
- What type of content ranks? (blog, product, video)
- What format? (list, guide, comparison)
- What depth? (word count, comprehensiveness)

**Step 2: Match Content Type**
```
If SERP shows: → Create:
- How-to guides → Step-by-step tutorial
- Listicles → Numbered list
- Videos → Video + transcript
- Product pages → Product comparison
- Reviews → Detailed review
```

**Step 3: Match Content Depth**
- Top results 500 words? Create 600 words
- Top results 2,000 words? Create 2,500 words
- Add more value, not just more words

## 2. Title Tag Optimization

### The Perfect Title Formula

**Pattern**: [Primary Keyword] [Modifier] | [Brand]

**Examples**:

```html
<!-- Informational -->
<title>How to Bake Sourdough Bread: Complete Beginner's Guide | BakingHub</title>

<!-- Commercial -->
<title>10 Best Laptops for College Students (2025 Review) | TechReviews</title>

<!-- Transactional -->
<title>Buy Organic Coffee Beans Online - Free Shipping | CoffeeShop</title>

<!-- Local -->
<title>Best Pizza in Brooklyn - Authentic Italian | Mario's Pizzeria</title>
```

### Title Tag Rules

**Length**: 50-60 characters (512px width)
- Too short: Missed opportunity
- Too long: Truncated in search results

**Keyword Placement**: Front-load primary keyword
```
✅ "Project Management Software: Features & Pricing | Brand"
❌ "Brand: The Best Solution for Project Management Software"
```

**Power Words**: Increase click-through rate
- Best, Top, Complete, Ultimate, Essential
- Guide, Checklist, Template, Tool
- 2025, New, Latest, Updated
- Free, Easy, Simple, Quick
- Proven, Expert, Professional

**Uniqueness**: Every page needs unique title
- No duplicate titles
- No "Untitled" or default titles
- Not just keyword stuffing

---

## 3. Meta Description Optimization

### The Perfect Meta Description

**Length**: 150-160 characters

**Formula**: [Problem] [Solution] [Benefit] [Call-to-Action]

**Examples**:

```html
<!-- Informational -->
<meta name="description" content="Learn how to bake perfect sourdough bread at home. Step-by-step guide with photos, timing tips, and troubleshooting. Start baking today!">

<!-- Commercial -->
<meta name="description" content="Compare the top 10 laptops for college students in 2025. We tested performance, battery life, and value. Find your perfect match!">

<!-- Transactional -->
<meta name="description" content="Shop organic coffee beans from around the world. Free shipping on orders over $30. 100% satisfaction guaranteed. Order now!">
```

### Meta Description Best Practices

**Include**:
- Primary keyword (naturally)
- Compelling benefit
- Call-to-action
- Unique selling point

**Avoid**:
- Duplicate descriptions
- Keyword stuffing
- Generic text ("Welcome to our site")
- Exceeding 160 characters

---

## 4. Heading Structure Optimization

### The Ideal Heading Hierarchy

```html
<h1>Single H1: Primary Topic with Primary Keyword</h1>

<h2>Main Section 1: Secondary Keyword</h2>
<p>Content for section 1...</p>

<h3>Subsection 1.1</h3>
<p>Supporting content...</p>

<h3>Subsection 1.2</h3>
<p>Supporting content...</p>

<h2>Main Section 2: Related Keyword</h2>
<p>Content for section 2...</p>

<h3>Subsection 2.1</h3>
<p>Supporting content...</p>

<h2>Main Section 3: LSI Keyword</h2>
<p>Content for section 3...</p>
```

### Heading Best Practices

**H1 Rules**:
- One H1 per page
- Include primary keyword
- 20-70 characters
- Compelling and descriptive
- Match (or similar to) title tag

**H2-H6 Rules**:
- Logical hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Descriptive, not generic
- Include related keywords naturally
- Break up long content
- Scannable for readers

**Bad Examples**:
```html
❌ <h1>Welcome</h1>
❌ <h1>Introduction</h1> <!-- Too generic -->
❌ <h2>Details</h2> <!-- Not descriptive -->
❌ <h1>Page Title</h1><h1>Another Title</h1> <!-- Multiple H1s -->
```

**Good Examples**:
```html
✅ <h1>Complete Guide to SEO for Beginners</h1>
✅ <h2>What is SEO and Why Does It Matter?</h2>
✅ <h3>On-Page SEO Fundamentals</h3>
```

- Standard blog post: 800-1,500 words
- Comprehensive guide: 1,500-3,000 words

## 6. Keyword Optimization

### Natural Keyword Usage

**Keyword Density**: 1-2% (not a hard rule, but guideline)

**Where to Include Keywords**:

1. **Title tag** (required)
2. **H1** (required)
3. **First 100 words** (required)
4. **H2-H3 headings** (1-2 times)
5. **Body content** (naturally throughout)
6. **Image alt text** (where relevant)
7. **URL slug** (if possible)
8. **Meta description** (once)

**LSI Keywords** (Latent Semantic Indexing):
Include semantically related terms:

```
Primary: "project management"
LSI terms:
- task management
- team collaboration
- project planning
- workflow optimization
- project tracking
- project organization
```

### Keyword Placement Example

```html
<title>Project Management Software: Complete Guide for Teams | Brand</title>

<p>
  Choosing the right <strong>project management software</strong> can
  transform how your team collaborates and delivers projects. This guide
  covers everything you need to know about task management tools, team
  collaboration platforms, and workflow optimization.

```

## 7. Internal Linking Strategy

### The 3 Types of Internal Links

**1. Navigational Links**:
- Header menu
- Footer links
- Sidebar navigation
- Breadcrumbs

**2. Contextual Links**:
- Links within content
- Most SEO value
- Natural anchor text

**3. Related Content Links**:
- "Related articles" section
- "You might also like"
- End of article links

### Internal Linking Best Practices

**How Many Links**:
- 2-5 internal links per 500 words
- Link to relevant, helpful content
- Don't overdo it (avoid "link farms")

**Anchor Text Guidelines**:

**Good Anchor Text**:
```html
<a href="/keyword-research-guide">comprehensive keyword research guide</a>
<a href="/on-page-seo">optimize your on-page SEO</a>
<a href="/content-strategy">content strategy framework</a>
```

**Bad Anchor Text**:
```html
<a href="/page1">click here</a>
<a href="/page2">read more</a>
<a href="/page3">this</a>
```

**Anchor Text Variety**:
- Exact match: 30% ("keyword research guide")
- Partial match: 40% ("guide to keyword research")
- Branded: 10% ("Brand's keyword guide")
- Natural: 20% ("learn more about finding keywords")

### Link Depth Strategy

```
Homepage (Strong Authority)
├─ Pillar Page 1 (receives authority from homepage)
│  ├─ Supporting Article 1 (receives authority from pillar)
│  ├─ Supporting Article 2
│  └─ Supporting Article 3
├─ Pillar Page 2
│  └─ Supporting Articles...
```

**Golden Rule**: Important pages should be ≤ 3 clicks from homepage

---

## 8. Image SEO Optimization

### Alt Text Best Practices

**Formula**: [What it is] + [Relevant context/keyword]

**Good Examples**:
```html
<img src="chocolate-chip-cookies.jpg"
     alt="Freshly baked chocolate chip cookies on cooling rack">

<img src="project-dashboard.jpg"
     alt="Project management software dashboard showing task list and progress charts">

<img src="ceo-headshot.jpg"
     alt="John Smith, CEO of TechCorp, headshot">
```

**Bad Examples**:
```html
<img alt="Image"> <!-- Too generic -->
<img alt="project management software tool dashboard task"> <!-- Keyword stuffing -->
<img alt=""> <!-- Missing alt text (unless decorative) -->
```

### Image Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Descriptive file names (chocolate-chip-cookies.jpg, not IMG_1234.jpg)
- [ ] Alt text on all non-decorative images
- [ ] Compressed images (TinyPNG, ImageOptim)
- [ ] Modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- [ ] Appropriate dimensions (don't serve 3000px image for 300px display)
- [ ] Lazy loading for below-fold images
