## Keyword Research Framework

### The 4-Step Research Process

**Step 1: Discovery** (Find all possible keywords)
**Step 2: Analysis** (Evaluate metrics and viability)
**Step 3: Prioritization** (Rank by opportunity)
**Step 4: Strategy** (Map to content plan)

---

## Step 1: Keyword Discovery

### A. Seed Keyword Generation

**Start with core topics**:
```
Your Product/Service → Core Features → User Benefits → Problem Solutions
```

**Example: Project Management Software**
```
Core Product: Project management tool
├─ Features: task management, team collaboration, time tracking
├─ Benefits: better organization, increased productivity
└─ Problems: missed deadlines, poor communication, scope creep

Seed Keywords:
- project management software
- task management tool
- team collaboration platform
- time tracking app
- project planning solution
```

### B. Keyword Expansion Techniques

#### 1. Question Keywords (High Intent)

**Who, What, Where, When, Why, How**:
```
Seed: "project management"

Questions:
- what is project management
- how to do project management
- why is project management important
- when to use project management software
- where to learn project management
- who needs project management tools
```

**Long-tail variations**:
```
- how to improve project management skills
- what are the best project management methodologies
- how much does project management software cost
- what features should project management software have
```

#### 2. Modifier Addition

**Common Modifiers**:

**Quality/Comparison**:
- best [keyword]
- top [keyword]
- [keyword] vs [keyword]
- [keyword] comparison
- [keyword] review
- [keyword] alternatives

**Price/Value**:
- cheap [keyword]
- affordable [keyword]
- free [keyword]
- premium [keyword]
- [keyword] pricing
- [keyword] cost

**Specificity**:
- [keyword] for [use case]
- [keyword] for [industry]
- [keyword] with [feature]
- [keyword] without [limitation]

**Location**:
- [keyword] near me
- [keyword] in [city]
- [keyword] [city]
- local [keyword]

**Time**:
- [keyword] 2025
- latest [keyword]
- new [keyword]
- modern [keyword]

#### 3. Alphabet Soup Method

**Google Autocomplete Pattern**:
```
project management a → project management app
project management b → project management basics
project management c → project management certification
...
project management z → project management zoom
```

**Also check**:
- "people also ask" boxes
- "related searches" at bottom of Google
- Google Trends "related queries"

#### 4. Competitor Keyword Mining

**Process**:
1. Identify top 5-10 competitors
2. Analyze their top-ranking pages
3. Extract keywords they rank for
4. Find gaps (keywords they have, you don't)
5. Find opportunities (keywords you can outrank them for)

**What to look for**:
- Their highest-traffic pages
- Keywords ranking in position 2-10 (easier to steal)
- Content formats that work (guides, tools, comparisons)
- Topics they haven't covered yet

### C. Keyword Sources

**Free Tools**:
- Google Search Autocomplete
- Google "People Also Ask"
- Google "Related Searches"
- Google Trends
- Answer the Public (limited free)
- Keyword Surfer (Chrome extension)
- Google Search Console (your existing keywords)

**Paid Tools** (most accurate data):
- Ahrefs Keywords Explorer
- SEMrush Keyword Magic Tool
- Moz Keyword Explorer
- Ubersuggest
- KWFinder

**Alternative Sources**:
- Reddit (subreddit searches)
- Quora (questions people ask)
- Amazon (product search autocomplete)
- YouTube (video search autocomplete)
- Wikipedia (table of contents for topic coverage)

---

## Step 2: Keyword Analysis

### A. Search Volume Assessment

**Volume Tiers**:

**High Volume** (10,000+ searches/month):
- Competitive (requires authority)
- Head terms (1-2 words)
- Brand awareness value
- Long-term targets

**Medium Volume** (1,000-10,000 searches/month):
- Balanced competition
- Body keywords (2-3 words)
- Good traffic potential
- Primary targets

**Low Volume** (100-1,000 searches/month):
- Often easier to rank
- Long-tail keywords (4+ words)
- Higher conversion intent
- Quick wins

**Micro Volume** (10-100 searches/month):
- Very specific
- High conversion potential
- Voice search queries
- Worth targeting if relevant

**Important**: Volume is relative to your niche. 500 searches/month in enterprise software might be valuable; in consumer products, it's tiny.

### B. Keyword Difficulty (Competition)

**Factors affecting difficulty**:

**Domain-Level Factors**:
- Domain Authority of ranking pages (top 10)
- Number of backlinks to ranking pages
- Brand strength of competitors
- Site age and authority

**Page-Level Factors**:
- Content depth and quality
- On-page optimization level
- User engagement metrics
- Number of backlinks to specific page

**SERP Features**:
- Featured snippets (opportunity!)
- "People Also Ask" boxes
- Local pack (local SEO needed)
- Shopping results (e-commerce intent)
- Video results (consider video content)

**Difficulty Scale** (0-100):

| Score | Difficulty | Who Can Rank | Strategy |
|-------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| 0-20 | Very Easy | New sites | Quick wins, target immediately |
| 21-40 | Easy | 6+ month sites | Focus area, achievable |
| 41-60 | Medium | 1+ year sites | Long-term investment |
| 61-80 | Hard | Established sites | Requires authority building |
| 81-100 | Very Hard | Major brands | Avoid unless strategic |

### C. Search Intent Classification

**The 4 Intent Types**:

#### 1. Informational Intent (Know/Learn)

**Characteristics**:
- User wants to learn
- Not ready to buy
- Top of funnel
- 80% of all searches

**Keyword Patterns**:
- how to...
- what is...
- guide to...
- [topic] tutorial
- learn [topic]
- [topic] tips

**Content Format**:
- Blog posts
- Guides and tutorials
- Videos
- Infographics
- FAQ pages

**Example**: "how to write a resume"

#### 2. Navigational Intent (Go/Find)

**Characteristics**:
- User looking for specific site/brand
- Already knows destination
- High specificity

**Keyword Patterns**:
- [brand name]
- [product name] login
- [company] support
- [tool name] download
- Facebook, YouTube, Amazon

**Content Format**:
- Homepage
- Product pages
- Login pages
- Brand pages

**Example**: "gmail login"

#### 3. Commercial Investigation (Research)

**Characteristics**:
- User comparing options
- Pre-purchase research
- Middle of funnel
- High conversion potential

**Keyword Patterns**:
- best [product]
- top [service]
- [product] review
- [product A] vs [product B]
- [product] comparison
- [product] alternatives

**Content Format**:
- Comparison articles
- Review posts
- "Best of" lists
- Product roundups
- Case studies

**Example**: "best project management software for small teams"

#### 4. Transactional Intent (Buy/Do)

**Characteristics**:
- Ready to purchase/convert
- Bottom of funnel
- Highest conversion value
- Commercial keywords

**Keyword Patterns**:
- buy [product]
- [service] pricing
- [product] discount
- [service] near me
- hire [professional]
- order [product]

**Content Format**:
- Product pages
- Pricing pages
- Landing pages
- Service pages
- E-commerce pages

**Example**: "buy standing desk online"

**Intent Matching is Critical**: Create content that matches intent. Transactional intent users don't want blog posts; informational intent users don't want product pages.

### D. Keyword Metrics to Track

**Essential Metrics**:

1. **Search Volume**: Monthly average searches
2. **Keyword Difficulty**: Competition level (0-100)
3. **Cost Per Click (CPC)**: Commercial value indicator
4. **Search Intent**: What users want
5. **SERP Features**: What appears in results
6. **Trend**: Rising, steady, or declining
7. **Seasonality**: When searches peak

**Derived Metrics**:

**Opportunity Score**:
```
Opportunity = (Volume × Commercial Value) / Difficulty

High opportunity = high volume, low difficulty
```

**Priority Score**:
```
Priority = (Opportunity Score × Intent Match × Business Relevance)
```

---

## Step 3: Keyword Prioritization

### The Keyword Scoring Matrix

**Score each keyword on**:

1. **Search Volume** (1-10):
   - 1 = < 10/month
   - 5 = 1,000/month
   - 10 = 10,000+/month

2. **Difficulty** (Reverse: 10-1):
   - 10 = Very Easy (0-20)
   - 5 = Medium (40-60)
   - 1 = Very Hard (80-100)

3. **Relevance** (1-10):
   - How well does this match your business?
   - 10 = Perfect match
   - 5 = Somewhat relevant
   - 1 = Barely relevant

4. **Intent Match** (1-10):
   - How well can you satisfy this intent?
   - 10 = Perfect content fit
   - 5 = Can create decent content
   - 1 = Poor fit

**Total Score** = Volume + (Difficulty × 2) + Relevance + Intent Match

**Maximum** = 50 points

**Priority Tiers**:
- 40-50: Target immediately (Quick Wins)
- 30-39: Target soon (Medium Priority)
- 20-29: Long-term targets
- < 20: Probably skip

### Quick Win Identification

**Ideal Quick Win Characteristics**:
- ✅ Low difficulty (< 30)
- ✅ Decent volume (> 100/month)
- ✅ High relevance
- ✅ Clear intent match
- ✅ No ranking yet or ranking poorly

**Example**:
```
Keyword: "how to prioritize tasks in project management"
Volume: 500/month
Difficulty: 25 (Easy)
Relevance: 10/10 (Perfect for PM software blog)
Intent: Informational (can create guide)
Score: 42/50 → Quick Win!
```

## Step 4: Keyword Strategy & Mapping

### A. Keyword Clustering

**Group related keywords into topic clusters**:

**Example Cluster: "Project Management Software"**
```
Hub Page (Main Topic): "Project Management Software"
├─ Subtopic 1: "Task Management Features"

   └─ billable hours tracking
```

**Benefits of Clustering**:
- Topical authority (Google rewards depth)

## Keyword Research Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Volume Obsession

**Mistake**: Chasing high-volume keywords regardless of difficulty
**Fix**: Prioritize winnable keywords with decent volume

### 2. Ignoring Intent

**Mistake**: Creating blog posts for transactional keywords
**Fix**: Match content type to search intent

### 3. Exact Match Fixation

**Mistake**: Forcing exact keyword into content awkwardly
**Fix**: Use semantic variations naturally

### 4. One-Keyword-One-Page

**Mistake**: Targeting single keyword per page
**Fix**: Target keyword clusters (5-10 related keywords per page)

### 5. No Long-Tail Strategy

**Mistake**: Only targeting head terms
**Fix**: Build long-tail foundation first, work up to head terms

### 6. Competitive Blindness

**Mistake**: Not checking who ranks currently
**Fix**: Always analyze top 10 results before targeting keyword

### 7. Static Research

**Mistake**: Research once, never update
**Fix**: Refresh research quarterly, monitor new opportunities
