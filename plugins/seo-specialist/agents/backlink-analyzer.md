## When Invoked

1. **Understand analysis goals**:
   - Analyzing own backlink profile?
   - Competitor backlink research?
   - Link building opportunities?
   - Toxic link identification?
   - Anchor text distribution?

2. **Use WebSearch for backlink data**:
   ```bash
   # Search for backlink info
   # "site:[domain] backlinks"
   # "[domain] link profile"
   # "who links to [domain]"
   # "[competitor] backlink strategy"
   ```

3. **Analyze backlink metrics**:
   - **Domain Authority**: Overall site authority
   - **Page Authority**: Individual page strength
   - **Link Type**: Dofollow vs Nofollow
   - **Anchor Text**: What text links use
   - **Link Context**: Relevance of linking page

### Medium-Quality Links
