# Research Methods Skill

**Expert patterns for research design, methodology, and data collection**

## Core Principles

1. **Align with Questions**: Methodology must answer research questions
2. **Rigor**: Follow established methodological standards
3. **Transparency**: Document all decisions and procedures
4. **Ethics First**: Protect participants and maintain integrity
5. **Validity**: Ensure findings are credible and trustworthy

### Question Structure

**Quantitative Questions**:
```
Does X affect Y?
To what extent does X predict Y?
What is the relationship between X and Y?
Is there a difference in Y between groups X1 and X2?
```

**Qualitative Questions**:
```
What is the experience of X?
How do people understand/perceive Y?
What processes are involved in X?
What is the meaning of Y in context Z?
```

**Mixed Methods Questions**:
```
What is the extent of X (quant) and why does it occur (qual)?
How do participants experience X (qual) and is this generalizable (quant)?
```

## Quantitative Research Designs

### Experimental Designs

**Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)**:
```
Strongest evidence for causation
Random assignment to groups
Intervention vs control
Pre/post measurements
Blinding when possible

Example: Drug efficacy trial
```

**Quasi-Experimental**:
```
No random assignment
Natural groups
Pre/post comparisons
Less internal validity

Example: Policy evaluation
```

### Non-Experimental Designs

**Cross-Sectional Survey**:
```
One-time data collection
Descriptive and correlational
Snapshot of population
Cannot establish causation

Sample size: Power analysis (typically n>100)
```

**Longitudinal**:
```
Repeated measurements
Track changes over time
Higher cost, attrition issues

Types: Cohort, panel, time-series
```

### Sampling for Quantitative

**Probability Sampling**:
- Simple random: Every member equal chance
- Stratified: Random from each subgroup
- Cluster: Sample groups, include all members
- Systematic: Every nth member

**Sample Size**:
```
Power analysis using:
  - Expected effect size
  - Alpha (typically 0.05)
  - Power (typically 0.80)
  - Statistical test

Rule of thumb:
  - Correlations: n ≥ 30
  - t-tests: n ≥ 30 per group
  - Regression: n ≥ 15 per predictor
  - SEM: n ≥ 200
```

## Qualitative Research Designs

### Grounded Theory

**Purpose**: Generate theory from data

**Process**:
```
1. Open coding: Initial categories
2. Axial coding: Relate categories
3. Selective coding: Core category
4. Theoretical saturation
5. Theory development
```

**Sample**: 20-30 participants typical

### Phenomenology

**Purpose**: Understand lived experience

**Approach**:
```
In-depth interviews
Bracketing (set aside assumptions)
Phenomenological reduction
Essence of experience
```

**Sample**: 10-15 participants

### Ethnography

**Purpose**: Understand culture/group

**Methods**:
```
Participant observation
Field notes
Interviews
Document analysis
Extended immersion (months/years)
```

**Sample**: Single culture/group in depth

### Case Study

**Purpose**: In-depth understanding of case

**Data Sources**:
```
Interviews
Observations
Documents
Artifacts
Multiple sources (triangulation)
```

**Cases**: 1-5 cases typical

### Sampling for Qualitative

**Purposive Sampling**:
- Maximum variation: Diverse cases
- Homogeneous: Similar cases
- Extreme/deviant: Unusual cases
- Typical: Average cases
- Critical: Test theory

**Sample Size**: Until theoretical saturation
- Phenomenology: 10-15
- Grounded theory: 20-30
- Ethnography: 1 group in-depth
- Case study: 1-5 cases

## Mixed Methods Designs

### Explanatory Sequential

```
QUANT → qual
Phase 1: Quantitative (survey, experiment)
  ↓
Phase 2: Qualitative (interviews explain results)
  ↓
Integration: Qual explains quant findings
```

**Use**: Explain unexpected quantitative findings

### Exploratory Sequential

```
QUAL → quant
Phase 1: Qualitative (interviews, observations)
  ↓
Phase 2: Quantitative (test qualitative findings)
  ↓
Integration: Quant tests qual findings
```

**Use**: Develop instrument from qualitative data

### Convergent Parallel

```
QUANT + QUAL → Compare
Collect both simultaneously
Analyze separately
Compare and integrate findings
```

**Use**: Triangulate, validate, expand understanding

## Data Collection Methods

### Surveys/Questionnaires

**Design Principles**:
- Clear, unambiguous questions
- Avoid double-barreled questions
- Avoid leading questions
- Logical flow
- Mix question types
- Pilot test thoroughly

**Question Types**:
- Closed-ended: Yes/no, multiple choice
- Likert scales: 1-5 or 1-7
- Ranking: Order preferences
- Semantic differential: Opposing adjectives
- Open-ended: Free text

**Validity**:
- Content: Covers construct fully
- Criterion: Predicts outcomes
- Construct: Measures intended construct
