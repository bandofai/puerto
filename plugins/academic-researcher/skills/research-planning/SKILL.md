# Research Planning Skill

**Expert patterns for project timelines, resource allocation, and research management**

## Core Principles

1. **Realistic Timelines**: Build in buffer time for delays
2. **Clear Milestones**: Define measurable progress points
3. **Resource Planning**: Budget time, money, personnel
4. **Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate risks
5. **Flexibility**: Allow for adjustments

## Project Timeline Development

### Standard Research Phases

**Phase 1: Planning (10-15% of time)**:
- Literature review
- Research questions
- Methodology design
- Ethics application
- Resource procurement

**Phase 2: Ethics & Piloting (10-15%)**:
- Ethics review process
- Protocol refinement
- Pilot study
- Instrument validation

**Phase 3: Data Collection (30-40%)**:
- Participant recruitment
- Data collection
- Quality monitoring
- Progress tracking

**Phase 4: Analysis (20-30%)**:
- Data preparation
- Statistical/thematic analysis
- Results interpretation
- Validation

**Phase 5: Writing & Dissemination (20-30%)**:
- Manuscript writing
- Revisions
- Submission
- Presentations

### Sample Timelines

**1-Year Master's Thesis**:
```
Month 1-2:   Literature review, methodology (15%)
Month 3:     Ethics approval, pilot (8%)
Month 4-6:   Data collection (25%)
Month 7-8:   Data analysis (17%)
Month 9-11:  Thesis writing (25%)
Month 12:    Final revisions, defense (10%)
```

**2-Year PhD Project**:
```
Month 1-3:   Literature review, proposal (12.5%)
Month 4-6:   Ethics, pilot study (12.5%)
Month 7-12:  Data collection Phase 1 (25%)
Month 13-15: Analysis Phase 1, Paper 1 (12.5%)
Month 16-18: Data collection Phase 2 (12.5%)
Month 19-21: Analysis Phase 2, Paper 2 (12.5%)
Month 22-24: Thesis writing, defense prep (12.5%)
```

**3-Year Funded Project**:
```
Year 1:      Planning, ethics, pilot, initial data
Year 2:      Full data collection, interim analysis
Year 3:      Final analysis, writing, dissemination
```

### Buffer Time Rule

**Add buffers for**:
- Ethics approval: +2 months beyond expected
- Recruitment: +50% more time than calculated
- Analysis: +25% for unexpected issues
- Writing/revisions: +30% for feedback cycles
- Overall: 10-15% contingency at project end

```

**Equipment** (10-15%):
```

```

**Indirect Costs** (varies by institution):
```
Institutional overhead (typically 20-50% of direct costs)
```

### Resource Allocation Matrix

```markdown
| Resource | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Total | % of Budget |
|----------|----|----|----|----|-------|-------------|
| PI time  | 40h| 80h|120h| 80h| 320h  | 30% |
| RA time  | 0  | 40h|160h| 80h| 280h  | 25% |
| Participants | $0 | $500 | $2000 | $500 | $3000 | 15% |
| Software | $500 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $500 | 5% |
| Travel   | $0 | $1000 | $500 | $1500 | $3000 | 15% |
| Other    | $200 | $200 | $200 | $400 | $1000 | 10% |
| **Total**| **$700** | **$1740** | **$2860** | **$2580** | **$10,000** | **100%** |
```

## Milestone Planning

### SMART Milestones

**S**pecific: Clearly defined
**M**easurable: Can verify completion
**A**chievable: Realistic given resources
**R**elevant: Contributes to project goals
**T**ime-bound: Has deadline

### Example Milestones

**Poor Milestones**:
- ❌ "Make progress on data collection"
- ❌ "Work on analysis"
- ❌ "Write thesis"

**Good Milestones**:
- ✅ "Complete recruitment of 50 participants by Month 6"
- ✅ "Finish thematic coding by Week 3 of Month 8"
- ✅ "Submit first draft of Chapter 3 by Month 10"

### Milestone Table

```markdown
| Milestone | Description | Target Date | Owner | Status | Actual Date |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|-------------|
| M1 | Literature review complete | Month 2 | Student | ✅ | 2024-02-15 |

## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment Matrix

**Likelihood**: Low (10%) | Medium (30-50%) | High (>70%)
**Impact**: Low (minor delay) | Medium (significant delay) | High (project failure)

**Priority**: High Likelihood + High Impact = Immediate attention

### Common Research Risks

**Risk 1: Ethics Approval Delayed**
```
Likelihood: Medium (30-40%)
Impact: High (delays all subsequent phases)
Mitigation:
  - Submit early (2-3 months before needed)
  - Build 2-month buffer into timeline
  - Prepare thorough application first time
  - Pre-review with ethics advisor
Contingency:
  - Use delay time for pilot testing
  - Refine instruments further
  - Expand literature review
```

**Risk 2: Low Recruitment Rate**
```
Likelihood: Medium-High (40-60%)
Impact: High (insufficient sample)
Mitigation:
  - Multiple recruitment channels
  - Over-recruit by 20-30%
  - Increase incentives (budget permitting)
  - Broaden inclusion criteria if appropriate
Contingency:
  - Extend recruitment period
  - Expand recruitment sites
  - Consider alternative sampling
  - Adjust analysis plan for smaller n
```

**Risk 3: Key Personnel Leave**
```
Likelihood: Low (10-20%)
Impact: High (loss of expertise, continuity)
Mitigation:
  - Cross-train team members
  - Document everything thoroughly
  - Identify backup personnel
  - Maintain good team relationships
Contingency:
  - Reallocate responsibilities
  - Hire replacement quickly
  - PI increases involvement
  - Reduce project scope if necessary
```

**Risk 4: Data Loss**
```
Likelihood: Low (5-10%)
Impact: High (catastrophic if no backup)
Mitigation:
  - Daily backups to cloud
  - Multiple backup locations
  - Version control (Git for code/docs)
  - Encrypted storage
  - Test restoration process
Contingency:
  - Restore from most recent backup
  - Re-collect if necessary (rare)
```

**Risk 5: Budget Overrun**
```
Likelihood: Medium (30%)
Impact: Medium (limits activities)
Mitigation:
  - Monthly budget monitoring
  - Conservative estimates
  - 10-15% contingency fund
  - Get quotes in advance
Contingency:
  - Reduce scope
  - Seek additional funding
  - Use free alternatives (software, etc.)
  - Adjust timeline to spread costs
```
