# Literature Review Skill

Comprehensive patterns for academic literature search, critical analysis, and synthesis.

## Literature Search Strategies

### Boolean Logic
- **AND**: Narrows (machine AND learning)
- **OR**: Broadens (AI OR "artificial intelligence")
- **NOT**: Excludes (medicine NOT veterinary)
- **Parentheses**: Groups ((deep OR machine) AND learning)

### Search Techniques
- **Truncation**: educat* (education, educational, educator)
- **Wildcards**: wom?n (woman, women)  
- **Phrase search**: "machine learning" (exact phrase)
- **Field search**: title:("climate change"), author:Smith

### Citation Tracking
- **Forward**: Who cited this paper?
- **Backward**: What did this cite?
- **Snowball**: Follow citation chains

## Critical Analysis Framework

### Quality Assessment
- **Study design**: Appropriate for question?
- **Sample**: Size adequate, representative?
- **Measures**: Valid, reliable?
- **Analysis**: Appropriate, rigorous?
- **Bias**: Minimized, acknowledged?
- **Results**: Clearly reported?

### Critical Reading Questions
1. What is the research question?
2. What methods were used?
3. What were the main findings?
4. What are the strengths?
5. What are the limitations?
6. How does this contribute to knowledge?

## Synthesis Approaches

### Thematic Synthesis
1. Code findings line-by-line
2. Develop descriptive themes
3. Generate analytical themes
4. Go beyond original studies

### Narrative Synthesis
- Tabulate studies
- Explore relationships within/between studies
- Assess robustness

### Meta-Analysis (quantitative)
- Calculate effect sizes
- Forest plots
- Heterogeneity assessment (IÂ²)
- Publication bias (funnel plots)

## Gap Identification

- **Knowledge gaps**: What we don't know
- **Methodological gaps**: Better methods needed
- **Population gaps**: Underrepresented groups
- **Contextual gaps**: Different settings
- **Theoretical gaps**: Mechanisms unclear
