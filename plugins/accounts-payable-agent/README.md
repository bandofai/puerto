### Quick Start

The agent activates automatically for AP tasks:

```
"Process this invoice PDF and extract the data"
"Route invoice INV-12345 for approval"
"Schedule payment for this invoice"
"Add new vendor: Acme Corporation"
"Reconcile invoice to purchase order"
```

The agent will:
1. ✅ Read the accounts payable skill (mandatory)
2. ✅ Execute the appropriate workflow
3. ✅ Validate data and check compliance
4. ✅ Save structured data to ap-data/
5. ✅ Provide summary with next steps

---

## Features & Examples

### 1. Invoice Processing with OCR

Extract structured data from PDF or image invoices automatically.

**Example Request**:
```
"Process this invoice PDF: /path/to/invoice.pdf"
```

**What Happens**:
1. **OCR Extraction**: Uses Tesseract or cloud OCR to extract text
2. **Data Parsing**: Identifies invoice number, date, vendor, amount, line items
3. **Validation**: Checks required fields, duplicates, amount reasonableness
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Assesses OCR accuracy, flags low-confidence for review
5. **Storage**: Saves JSON data and original file

**Output** (`ap-data/invoices/INV-20250119-ABC123.json`):
```json
{
  "invoice_id": "INV-20250119-ABC123",
  "invoice_number": "VENDOR-INV-5678",
  "invoice_date": "2025-01-15",
  "due_date": "2025-02-14",
  "vendor_name": "Acme Corporation",
  "vendor_id": "VENDOR-001",
  "total_amount": 5250.00,
  "line_items": [
    {
      "description": "Office Supplies - Paper",
      "quantity": 50,
      "unit_price": 25.00,
      "amount": 1250.00
    },
    {
      "description": "Office Supplies - Pens",
      "quantity": 100,
      "unit_price": 40.00,
      "amount": 4000.00
    }
  ],
  "tax_amount": 0.00,
  "payment_terms": "Net 30",
  "ocr_confidence": 0.92,
  "validation_status": "passed",
  "processed_date": "2025-01-19T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Validation Checks**:
- Required fields present (vendor, amount, date, invoice number)
- No duplicate invoice number for this vendor
- Invoice date not in future or too old (>180 days)
- Amount positive and reasonable (<$1M threshold for auto-process)
- Line items sum to total (with tax)

---

### 2. Intelligent Approval Routing

Route invoices to appropriate approvers based on amount and department.

**Example Request**:
```
"Route this $15,000 invoice for approval"
```

**Approval Matrix** (from skill):
- **$0 - $1,000**: Manager only
- **$1,000 - $5,000**: Manager + Department Head
- **$5,000 - $25,000**: Manager + Dept Head + Finance Director
- **$25,000 - $100,000**: Manager + Dept Head + Finance + CFO
- **$100,000+**: Full executive approval (+ CEO)

**Output** (`ap-data/approvals/INV-20250119-ABC123_approval.json`):
```json
{
  "invoice_id": "INV-20250119-ABC123",
  "amount": 15000.00,
  "approval_workflow": "sequential",
  "approvers": [
    {
      "level": 1,
      "role": "manager",
      "name": "Alice Johnson",
      "email": "alice@company.com",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "level": 2,
      "role": "department_head",
      "name": "Bob Smith",
      "email": "bob@company.com",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "level": 3,
      "role": "finance_director",
      "name": "Carol Lee",
      "email": "carol@company.com",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ],
  "current_approver": "alice@company.com",
  "sent_date": "2025-01-19T10:35:00Z"
}
```

**Approval Features**:
- Automatic routing based on amount thresholds
- Department-specific approval rules
- Sequential or parallel workflows
- Delegation handling (out-of-office)
- Escalation for stuck approvals (>3 days)
- Email notifications generated

---

### 3. Payment Scheduling Optimization

Schedule payments to optimize discounts and cash flow.

**Example Request**:
```
"Schedule payment for invoice INV-12345 with terms 2/10 Net 30"
```

**Payment Terms Handled**:
- Net 30, Net 60, Net 90
- 2/10 Net 30 (2% discount if paid in 10 days)
- 1/10 Net 30
- Due on Receipt
- EOM (End of Month)
- COD (Cash on Delivery)

**Optimization Strategy**:
```
Invoice Amount: $10,000
Payment Terms: 2/10 Net 30
Invoice Date: 2025-01-15

Option 1: Pay by discount date (2025-01-25)
  - Save: $200 (2% discount)
  - Annualized ROI: 36.5%
  - Recommendation: TAKE DISCOUNT

Option 2: Pay on due date (2025-02-14)
  - Hold cash 20 extra days
  - Cost: $200 in lost discount

Decision: Pay on 2025-01-25 to capture discount
```

**Output** (`ap-data/payments/INV-20250119-ABC123_schedule.json`):
```json
{
  "invoice_id": "INV-20250119-ABC123",
  "invoice_amount": 10000.00,
  "payment_terms": "2/10 Net 30",
  "invoice_date": "2025-01-15",
  "due_date": "2025-02-14",
  "discount_date": "2025-01-25",
  "discount_amount": 200.00,
  "discount_roi_annualized": 36.5,
  "scheduled_payment_date": "2025-01-25",
  "payment_amount": 9800.00,
  "payment_method": "ACH",
  "recommendation": "Take early payment discount - excellent ROI",
  "cash_flow_impact": "Low - within budget"
}
```

**Scheduling Policies**:
- `aggressive_discounts`: Always take discounts
- `balanced`: Take discounts if ROI > 18%
- `conservative_cash`: Hold cash unless ROI > 36%

---

### 4. Vendor Database Management

Maintain comprehensive vendor records with compliance tracking.

**Example Request**:
```
"Add new vendor: Acme Corporation, Tax ID 12-3456789, email ar@acme.com"
```

**Vendor Onboarding Workflow**:
1. Validate vendor information
2. Check for duplicate vendors (by name, tax ID, bank account)
3. Request W-9 form
4. Setup payment information
5. Assign vendor ID
6. Set compliance status (Pending until W-9 received)

**Output** (`ap-data/vendors/VENDOR-20250119-ABC123.json`):
```json
{
  "vendor_id": "VENDOR-20250119-ABC123",
  "vendor_name": "Acme Corporation",
  "legal_name": "Acme Corporation Inc.",
  "tax_id": "12-3456789",
  "contact": {
    "primary_contact_name": "John Smith",
    "email": "ar@acme.com",
    "phone": "555-123-4567"
  },
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main Street",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "zip": "10001",
    "country": "USA"
  },
  "payment": {
    "preferred_method": "ACH",
    "payment_terms": "Net 30",
    "bank_account": {
      "bank_name": "First National Bank",
      "routing_number": "021000021",
      "account_number": "****7890",
      "account_type": "Checking"
    }
  },
  "tax_compliance": {
    "w9_on_file": false,
    "w9_requested_date": "2025-01-19",
    "1099_eligible": true
  },
  "status": "Pending",
  "risk_level": "Medium",
  "created_date": "2025-01-19T11:00:00Z"
}
```

**Vendor Performance Tracking**:
- Total spend (YTD, lifetime)
- Average payment days (how fast we pay)
- On-time payment rate
- Dispute count and quality rating
- 1099 reporting status

---

### 5. Three-Way Match Reconciliation

Reconcile invoices to purchase orders and receipts.

**Example Request**:
```
"Reconcile invoice INV-12345 to purchase order"
```

**Three-Way Match Process**:
```
1. Purchase Order (PO) → What was ordered
   ↓
2. Goods Receipt Note (GRN) → What was received
   ↓
3. Invoice → What vendor is billing
   ↓
COMPARE: If all three match → Approve for payment
```

**Comparison Checks**:
- Vendor matches PO
- Total amount within tolerance (±5% or $10)
- Line item quantities don't exceed PO or receipt
- Unit prices within tolerance (±2%)

**Output** (`ap-data/reconciliation/INV-20250119-ABC123_match_report.md`):
```markdown
# Three-Way Match Report: INV-20250119-ABC123

**Generated**: 2025-01-19 11:15:00

---

## Match Status: ✅ MATCHED (Minor Discrepancies)

---

## Comparison Results

### Vendor
✅ **MATCHED**: Acme Corporation (ID: VENDOR-001)

### Amount
⚠️ **MINOR VARIANCE**:
- PO Amount: $5,000.00
- Invoice Amount: $5,250.00
- Variance: $250.00 (5.0%)
- **Within tolerance** (≤5% or $10)

### Line Items

#### Item 1: Office Supplies - Paper
- PO Quantity: 50
- Received: 50
- Invoiced: 50
- ✅ **MATCHED**

- PO Unit Price: $25.00
- Invoice Unit Price: $25.00
- ✅ **MATCHED**

#### Item 2: Office Supplies - Pens
- PO Quantity: 100
- Received: 100
- Invoiced: 100
- ✅ **MATCHED**

- PO Unit Price: $40.00
- Invoice Unit Price: $40.00
- ✅ **MATCHED**

---

## Discrepancies Found

1. **Minor - Amount Variance**
   - Severity: Minor
   - Issue: Invoice $250 higher than PO (5%)
   - Possible Cause: Shipping charges or tax
   - Recommendation: Verify with vendor, likely acceptable

---

## Recommendation

**Action**: Manager Approval Required

While the match is successful, the 5% variance requires manager review to confirm shipping/tax charges are valid.

**Next Steps**:
1. Manager reviews invoice for additional charges
2. If valid: Approve for payment
3. If invalid: Request corrected invoice

```

---

### 6. Exception Handling

Detect and resolve common AP exceptions.

**Common Exceptions Handled**:

| Exception | Severity | Action | Resolution |
|-----------|----------|--------|------------|
| Duplicate Invoice | High | Reject | Verify with vendor, check if re-sent |
| No PO Found | Medium | Manual Review | Check if PO required, obtain retroactive approval |
| PO Mismatch | Medium | Manual Review | Investigate discrepancy, request corrected invoice |
| Missing Receipt | High | Hold | Verify delivery, create receipt if received |
| Amount Over PO | High | Manager Approval | Check change orders, verify authorization |
| Vendor Not in System | Medium | Hold | Initiate vendor onboarding |
| Sales Tax Issue | Medium | Manual Review | Recalculate tax, request correction |
| Missing W-9 | High | Hold | Cannot pay without W-9 (1099 risk) |

**Example - Duplicate Detection**:
```
Invoice INV-NEW-001 detected as duplicate

Original Invoice:
- ID: INV-20250110-XYZ789
- Vendor: Acme Corporation
- Invoice #: VENDOR-INV-5678
- Amount: $5,250.00
- Status: Paid on 2025-01-18

Current Invoice:
- Invoice #: VENDOR-INV-5678 (SAME)
- Amount: $5,250.00 (SAME)

Action: REJECTED - Duplicate invoice
Reason: Invoice number already processed and paid
Recommendation: Contact vendor to verify if this is a re-send or different invoice
```

---

### 7. Fraud Detection

Identify suspicious patterns and flag for investigation.

**Fraud Indicators Checked**:
- New vendor with large first invoice (>$10K)
- Recent bank account change (<30 days)
- Invoice number not sequential
- Similar vendor names (potential duplicate fraud)
- Round number amounts
- Amount just under approval threshold
- Weekend or holiday invoice date

**Example - Fraud Alert**:
```
🚨 FRAUD RISK DETECTED: Invoice INV-20250119-XYZ

Risk Score: 75/100 (HIGH RISK)

Indicators Found:
1. [HIGH] New Vendor + Large Amount
   - Vendor created: 2025-01-15 (4 days ago)
   - Invoice amount: $18,500 (above $10K threshold)

2. [HIGH] Similar Vendor Names
   - "Acme Corporation LLC" (this invoice)
   - "Acme Corporation Inc" (VENDOR-001) - 95% match
   - Potential duplicate or fraudulent vendor

3. [MEDIUM] Amount Just Under Threshold
   - Invoice: $18,500
   - Approval threshold: $20,000
   - Variance: 7.5% under threshold

Recommended Action: HOLD AND INVESTIGATE

Investigation Steps:
1. Verify vendor legitimacy (website, phone, references)
2. Compare bank accounts with existing "Acme Corporation"
3. Contact requester to verify purchase
4. Confirm with vendor via known contact (not invoice contact)
5. Executive approval required even if validated

DO NOT PROCESS PAYMENT until investigation complete.
```

## Compliance & Controls

### Segregation of Duties (SOD)

**Critical SOD Rules Enforced**:

```
Role Separation:
├── Invoice Entry → AP Clerk A
├── Invoice Approval → Manager (DIFFERENT PERSON)
├── Payment Processing → AP Clerk B (DIFFERENT from entry)
└── Bank Reconciliation → Accountant (DIFFERENT from all above)
```

**SOD Violations Prevented**:
- Person who enters invoice cannot approve it
- Person who approves cannot process payment
- Person who processes payment cannot reconcile bank
- Person who sets up vendor cannot process payments to that vendor

**Example SOD Check**:
```
❌ SOD VIOLATION DETECTED

User: alice@company.com
Action: Attempting to approve invoice
Issue: You entered this invoice

SOD Rule: invoice_entry_and_approval
Severity: CRITICAL

You cannot approve an invoice you entered.

Required: Different person must approve.
```

### Audit Trail

**All Actions Logged**:
- Invoice created, updated, approved, rejected, paid
- Vendor created, updated, bank account changed
- Payment processed, voided, reconciled
- Exceptions detected and resolved
- Fraud alerts triggered

**Audit Log Entry** (`ap-data/audit/audit-log-2025-01.json`):

```

### 1099 Tax Compliance

**Automatic 1099 Tracking**:
- Identifies 1099-eligible vendors
- Tracks total payments per vendor per year
- Flags when threshold reached ($600+)
- Generates 1099 report at year-end

**Example 1099 Report**:
```json
{
  "tax_year": 2024,
  "generated_date": "2025-01-05",
  "vendor_count": 12,

## Best Practices

### Invoice Processing
✅ **DO**:
- Use OCR for all PDF/image invoices
- Validate invoice data before processing
- Check for duplicates every time
- Track OCR confidence and review low-confidence invoices
- Match to PO when available (three-way match)

❌ **DON'T**:
- Process invoices without validation
- Skip duplicate checking
- Ignore invoices older than 180 days without investigation
- Process without checking vendor exists

### Approval Routing
✅ **DO**:
- Follow approval matrix strictly
- Handle approver absence (delegation)
- Escalate stuck approvals (>3 days)
- Send clear approval notification emails
- Log all approval actions

❌ **DON'T**:
- Skip approval levels for trusted vendors
- Let invoices sit pending indefinitely
- Allow same person to enter and approve
- Process without documented approval

### Payment Scheduling
✅ **DO**:
- Always capture discounts with ROI >18%
- Schedule payments to respect due dates
- Batch payments by vendor for efficiency
- Use ACH for cost savings
- Communicate payment schedule to vendors

❌ **DON'T**:
- Pay early without discount benefit
- Pay late habitually (damages relationships)
- Use expensive payment methods unnecessarily
- Surprise vendors with delays

### Vendor Management
✅ **DO**:
- Onboard vendors formally
- Collect W-9 before first payment
- Validate bank account changes carefully
- Track vendor performance
- Clean up inactive vendors

❌ **DON'T**:
- Skip vendor onboarding
- Pay without W-9 (1099 risk)
- Allow vendor self-service bank updates without verification
- Keep duplicate vendors in database

### Compliance
✅ **DO**:
- Enforce segregation of duties
- Maintain comprehensive audit trail
- Track 1099 payments throughout year
- Check fraud indicators on all invoices
- Document policy exceptions

❌ **DON'T**:
- Allow SOD violations
- Skip audit logging
- Wait until year-end for 1099 tracking
- Ignore fraud red flags
- Process suspicious invoices without investigation

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: OCR Extraction Fails

**Symptoms**: Cannot extract invoice data from PDF

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Tesseract installed: `tesseract --version`
2. Check PDF is not encrypted: Try opening in PDF reader
3. For poor quality scans, use preprocessing:
   ```bash
   # Improve image quality before OCR
   convert invoice.pdf -density 300 -quality 100 invoice_high_res.pdf
   ```
4. Consider cloud OCR (AWS Textract) for better accuracy

### Issue: Approval Routing Not Working

**Symptoms**: Approvers not determined correctly

**Solution**: Verify approval matrix in skill Section 2.1 matches your org structure

```python
# Update APPROVAL_MATRIX in skill to match your thresholds
APPROVAL_MATRIX = {
    'thresholds': [
        {
            'min_amount': 0,
            'max_amount': YOUR_THRESHOLD,
            'approvers': YOUR_ROLES
        }
    ]
}
```

### Issue: SOD Violation Warnings

**Symptoms**: Getting blocked from processing invoices

**Solution**: SOD rules are working correctly! Different people must:
- Enter invoices vs. approve them
- Approve invoices vs. process payments
- Process payments vs. reconcile bank

Assign tasks to different team members per SOD matrix.

### Issue: 1099 Tracking Missing Data

**Symptoms**: Year-end 1099 report incomplete

**Solution**:
1. Verify all vendors have `1099_eligible` flag set correctly
2. Ensure `tax_id` (EIN) captured for all 1099 vendors
3. Check W-9 forms on file
4. Re-run vendor performance tracking to recalculate totals

---

## Customization

### Adjust Approval Thresholds

Edit `skills/accounts-payable/SKILL.md` Section 2.1:

```python
APPROVAL_MATRIX = {
    'thresholds': [
        {
            'min_amount': 0,
            'max_amount': 1000,
            'approvers': ['manager'],
            'description': 'Manager approval only'
        },
        # Add your custom thresholds here
    ]
}
```

### Add Department-Specific Rules

```python
'department_rules': {
    'IT': {
        'software_threshold': 10000,  # IT manager approves software <$10K
        'hardware_threshold': 25000
    },
    'YOUR_DEPT': {
        'custom_threshold': YOUR_AMOUNT
    }
}
```

### Configure Payment Policies

```python
# In Section 3.2, adjust cash flow policy:
cash_flow_policy = 'aggressive_discounts'  # Always take discounts
# OR
cash_flow_policy = 'balanced'  # Take discounts if ROI >18%
# OR
cash_flow_policy = 'conservative_cash'  # Hold cash, only take exceptional discounts
```

## Advanced Features

### Payment Batching

Group payments for efficiency:

```bash
# Batch payments by vendor (one payment per vendor)
python3 batch_payments.py --strategy by_vendor

# Batch by payment method (all ACH together, all checks together)
python3 batch_payments.py --strategy by_method

# Optimal batching (minimize transaction count)
python3 batch_payments.py --strategy optimal
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduce transaction fees
- Simplify reconciliation
- Vendor receives single payment for multiple invoices

### ACH File Generation

Create NACHA-formatted ACH files for bank submission:

```bash
# Generate ACH file for payment batch
python3 generate_ach.py --batch payment-batch-20250120.json --output payment.ach
```

**ACH File** (`payment.ach`):
```
101 021000021 1234567890250119103000000001
5200Acme Company                        1234567890CCDAP PAYMENT    250120   1021000020000001

```

Submit to your bank for processing.

### Vendor Performance Analytics

Track and score vendor performance:

```python
vendor_metrics = calculate_vendor_metrics(vendor_id='VENDOR-001', period='ytd')

print(f"Total Spend: ${vendor_metrics['total_spend']:,.2f}")
print(f"Invoice Count: {vendor_metrics['invoice_count']}")
print(f"Avg Payment Days: {vendor_metrics['average_payment_days']:.1f}")
print(f"On-Time Payment Rate: {vendor_metrics['on_time_payment_rate']*100:.1f}%")
print(f"Quality Score: {vendor_metrics['quality_score']}/5")
```

Use metrics to:
- Negotiate better terms with high-volume vendors
- Identify and resolve payment issues
- Recognize top-performing vendors
- Flag problematic vendor relationships

## Performance Characteristics

**Processing Speed**:
- Invoice OCR + extraction: 10-15 seconds per invoice
- Validation + duplicate check: 2-3 seconds
- Approval routing: <1 second
- Payment scheduling: <1 second
- Three-way match: 3-5 seconds
- Fraud detection: 2-3 seconds

**Token Usage** (using Sonnet):
- Invoice processing: 8K-12K tokens
- Approval routing: 3K-5K tokens
- Payment scheduling: 4K-6K tokens
- Reconciliation: 6K-10K tokens
- Fraud detection: 5K-8K tokens

**Cost** (Sonnet pricing):
- Invoice processing: ~$0.15 per invoice
- Approval routing: ~$0.05
- Payment scheduling: ~$0.07
- Reconciliation: ~$0.12
- Monthly cost (250 invoices): ~$97.50

**ROI**: Highly cost-effective. One prevented duplicate payment or one captured early payment discount typically pays for months of automation.

---

## Model Requirements

**Required Model**: Sonnet (claude-sonnet-4-5)

**Why Sonnet** (not Haiku):
- Invoice exception handling requires judgment
- Approval routing needs business logic interpretation
- Reconciliation requires pattern matching and anomaly detection
- Fraud detection needs subtle signal recognition
- Complex workflows with multiple decision points
- Professional communication for approval requests

Haiku not recommended for AP due to compliance and financial risks.

---

## Security Considerations

**Data Security**:
- All invoice files stored locally (not sent to external services unless using cloud OCR)
- Sensitive vendor data (bank accounts) encrypted
- Audit logs immutable (append-only)
- Access control via file permissions

**PII/Financial Data**:
- Tax IDs (EINs) stored securely
- Bank account numbers masked in logs (****7890)
- Payment amounts logged for audit
- Vendor contact information protected

**Compliance**:
- SOX compliance (audit trails, segregation of duties)
- GAAP accounting principles followed
- 1099 tax reporting supported
- Retention policies configurable

## FAQ

**Q: Can this replace our AP software?**
A: No, this is an automation layer that works with your existing AP/ERP system. It automates invoice processing, routing, and analysis while your ERP handles GL posting and official records.

**Q: Does it work with our ERP (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite)?**
A: Yes! The plugin generates structured data (JSON) that can be imported into any ERP. You'll need to build integration scripts specific to your ERP's API.

**Q: How accurate is the OCR?**
A: Tesseract (local): 85-92% accuracy on clean invoices. Cloud OCR (AWS Textract, Google Vision): 95-98% accuracy. Low-confidence extractions are flagged for manual review.

**Q: Can it handle international vendors?**
A: Yes, with customization. Multi-currency support requires exchange rate lookups. International tax compliance (VAT, GST) may need additional rules.

**Q: What about electronic invoices (EDI, XML)?**
A: Currently optimized for PDF/image invoices. Electronic invoice formats can be parsed directly (no OCR needed) with custom parsers.

**Q: How do I handle exceptions?**
A: The agent detects exceptions and routes them per the playbook in skill Section 6. Each exception type has defined resolution steps.

**Q: Is it SOX compliant?**
A: The agent enforces SOX requirements (segregation of duties, audit trails, controls) but your organization must ensure proper implementation and review.

**Q: Can multiple people use it?**
A: Yes! Different team members handle different steps (entry, approval, payment) to maintain SOD. Coordinate via the ap-data/ shared directory.
