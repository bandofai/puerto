# Invoice Generation Skill

Comprehensive patterns for professional, compliant invoice generation.

## Professional Invoice Structure

### Header Section
- Company logo and branding
- Legal business name and entity type (LLC, Inc, Corp)
- Complete business address with jurisdiction
- Tax identification numbers (EIN for US, VAT/GST for international)
- Contact information (phone, email, website)
- **Invoice number**: Sequential numbering system (INV-YYYY-NNNNN)
- **Invoice date**: Date invoice created
- **Due date**: Based on payment terms
- **Payment terms**: Net 30, Net 60, 2/10 Net 30, etc.

### Customer Information
- **Bill-to**: Legal entity name and billing address
- **Ship-to**: Delivery address (if different from billing)
- Customer account number
- Payment terms reference
- Purchase order number (if applicable)
- Tax exempt status and certificate number

### Line Item Detail
Each line item must include:
- Line number (sequential)
- Description (clear, specific)
- Quantity
- Unit of measure (hours, units, licenses, etc.)
- Unit price
- Extended amount (quantity Ã— unit price)
- Taxable flag (yes/no)
- Tax rate and amount
- GL account code (for accounting integration)
- Revenue recognition category

**Description Standards**:
- Be specific: "Professional Services - Web Development, January 2025" not "Services"
- Include dates/periods: "Annual Subscription (Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2025)"
- Reference work: "Project Phoenix - Phase 2 Implementation"

### Summary Section
Calculation order (critical for accuracy):
1. **Subtotal**: Sum of all line item extended amounts
2. **Discount**: Apply percentage or fixed amount discount
3. **Taxable Amount**: Subtotal minus non-taxable items
4. **Tax**: Calculate on taxable amount per jurisdiction
5. **Total Amount Due**: Subtotal - Discount + Tax
6. **Currency**: Clearly specify (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)

### Footer Section
- Payment methods accepted (ACH, wire, credit card, check)
- Remittance instructions (bank details, mailing address)
- Payment terms (e.g., "Payment due within 30 days of invoice date")
- Late payment terms ("1.5% monthly interest on overdue balances")
- Early payment discount ("2% discount if paid within 10 days")
- Dispute deadline ("Disputes must be raised within 30 days")
- Customer service contact
- Terms and conditions reference

## Tax Calculation Framework

### Sales Tax (US)
**Nexus Determination**:
- Physical presence (office, warehouse, employee)
- Economic nexus (revenue/transaction thresholds by state)
- Marketplace facilitator rules

**Rate Application**:
```
Customer address: San Francisco, CA 94102
State rate: 7.25%
County rate: 0%
City rate: 0%
District rate: 1.5%
Total rate: 8.75%
```

**Tax-Exempt Handling**:
- Require valid exemption certificate
- Verify certificate expiration
- Match certificate to customer and jurisdiction
- Document exemption reason (resale, nonprofit, government)
- Maintain certificate file for audit

### VAT/GST (International)
**VAT Calculation**:
- Standard rate: 20% (UK), 19% (Germany), varies by country
- Reduced rates for specific goods/services
- Zero-rated vs. exempt distinction

**Reverse Charge Mechanism**:
- B2B sales to VAT-registered customers in other EU countries
- Customer pays VAT, not seller
- Invoice must state "Reverse charge applies"
- Include customer VAT number

**Export Documentation**:
- Proof of export required for zero-rating
- Commercial invoice
- Shipping documentation
- Customs declarations

## Revenue Recognition Integration (ASC 606)

### Performance Obligation Tagging
Each invoice line item must specify:
```json
{
  "performance_obligation_id": "PO-001",
  "description": "Software License",
  "recognition_type": "point_in_time",
  "recognition_trigger": "delivery",
  "allocated_value": 10000.00,
  "contract_reference": "CONTRACT-2025-001"
}
```

### Recognition Types

**Point-in-Time** (recognize upon delivery):
- Product sales
- One-time services
- Software licenses (when delivered)
- Triggers: delivery, customer acceptance, title transfer

**Over-Time** (recognize throughout service period):
- Subscriptions
- Maintenance contracts
- Long-term services
- Triggers: time elapsed, milestones achieved, percentage complete

### Deferred Revenue Calculation
```
Annual subscription: $12,000 paid upfront on Jan 1

Journal entries:
Jan 1:
  DR Cash                      $12,000
     CR Deferred Revenue               $12,000

Monthly (Jan 31, Feb 28, etc.):
  DR Deferred Revenue         $1,000
     CR Revenue                        $1,000
```
