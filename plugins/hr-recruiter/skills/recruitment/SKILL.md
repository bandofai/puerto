## Part 2: Job Description Creation

### Job Description Best Practices

**Structure**: Every job description should follow this proven structure:

1. **About the Company** (50-150 words)
   - Mission and values
   - What makes the company unique
   - Culture highlights
   - Impact/market position

2. **The Role** (50-100 words)
   - What they'll do
   - Why it matters
   - Who they'll work with
   - What success looks like

3. **Responsibilities** (5-8 bullet points)
   - Start with action verbs
   - Be specific and concrete
   - Focus on impact, not just tasks
   - Order by importance

4. **Required Qualifications** (4-6 items)
   - Truly must-have only
   - Be realistic (avoid wish lists)
   - Include years of experience if relevant
   - Specify technical requirements clearly

5. **Preferred Qualifications** (3-5 items)
   - Nice-to-haves
   - Growth areas
   - Bonus skills

6. **What We Offer** (5-8 items)
   - Compensation (range if possible)
   - Benefits
   - Growth opportunities
   - Work arrangement
   - Unique perks

7. **Diversity Statement**
   - Commitment to inclusion
   - Equal opportunity employer statement

8. **How to Apply**
   - Application process
   - Timeline expectations
   - Point of contact

### Inclusive Language Guidelines

**DO USE**:
- ✅ Gender-neutral terms: "they/them", "folks", "team members"
- ✅ "Minimum of X years" instead of "X+ years"
- ✅ "Encouraged to apply" instead of "must have"
- ✅ "You'll thrive if" instead of "ideal candidate is"
- ✅ "Salary range: $X-Y" (transparency)
- ✅ "Remote/hybrid/flexible" (clarity on work arrangement)

**AVOID**:
- ❌ Gendered language: "he/she", "guys", "rockstar", "ninja"
- ❌ Age indicators: "recent graduate", "digital native", "experienced professional"
- ❌ Unnecessarily exclusionary: "must have degree from top university"
- ❌ Aggressive tone: "elite", "cutthroat", "competitive"
- ❌ Vague requirements: "excellent communication skills" without context
- ❌ Long lists that discourage applicants

**Research shows**:
- Women apply when they meet 100% of qualifications
- Men apply when they meet 60% of qualifications
- Solution: Keep required qualifications realistic and use "preferred" section

## Part 6: Diversity & Inclusion

### Inclusive Hiring Checklist

**Job Postings**:
- [ ] Language checked for bias (use tools: Textio, Gender Decoder)
- [ ] Requirements are truly required (not wish lists)
- [ ] Inclusive benefits highlighted (parental leave, flexibility)
- [ ] Diverse team photos if using imagery
- [ ] Accessible application process

**Sourcing**:
- [ ] Post to diverse job boards
- [ ] Partner with diversity-focused organizations
- [ ] Employee referrals from diverse employees encouraged
- [ ] Proactive outreach to underrepresented groups
- [ ] Remove identifying information for blind screening (if applicable)

**Screening**:
- [ ] Standardized evaluation rubric used
- [ ] Multiple reviewers to reduce individual bias
- [ ] Focus on skills and achievements, not pedigree
- [ ] Consider non-traditional backgrounds and career paths
- [ ] Give credit for transferable skills

**Interviewing**:
- [ ] Consistent interview questions across candidates
- [ ] Diverse interview panels
- [ ] Interviewers trained on unconscious bias
- [ ] Structured scoring rubrics
- [ ] Accommodate candidate needs (timing, accessibility)

**Decision-Making**:
- [ ] Documented evaluation criteria
- [ ] Compare candidates against role, not each other
- [ ] Question gut feelings with evidence
- [ ] Ensure diverse finalist pools
- [ ] Leadership buy-in on diversity goals

### Unconscious Bias Awareness

**Common Biases to Watch For**:

1. **Affinity Bias**: Favoring candidates similar to ourselves
   - *Mitigation*: Diverse interview panels, structured evaluations

2. **Halo Effect**: One positive trait influences overall assessment
   - *Mitigation*: Evaluate each criterion independently

3. **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking information that confirms initial impression
   - *Mitigation*: Blind screening, devil's advocate reviews

4. **Recency Bias**: Remembering recent candidates better
   - *Mitigation*: Document evaluations immediately, compare side-by-side

5. **Attribution Bias**: Attributing success to circumstances for some, ability for others
   - *Mitigation*: Ask same questions about context and contribution

**Inclusive Language Guide**:

Replace → With:
- "Cultural fit" → "Values alignment" or "Team collaboration"
- "Aggressive" → "Results-driven" or "Assertive"
- "Rockstar/Ninja" → "Skilled" or "Expert"
- "Recent graduate" → "Early career" or remove entirely
- "Native English speaker" → "Strong communication skills"
- "Strong work ethic" → "Consistent track record of meeting deadlines"
