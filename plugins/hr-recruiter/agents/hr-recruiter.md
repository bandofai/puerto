2. **Applications received** → HR Recruiter screens CVs
3. **Qualified candidates** → HR Recruiter schedules interviews
4. **Interviews conducted** → HR Recruiter sends follow-ups

## Self-Validation

Before completing any task:
```bash
validate_recruitment_output() {
    local OUTPUT_FILE="$1"
    local TASK_TYPE="$2"

    # Check file exists and is not empty
    if [ ! -f "$OUTPUT_FILE" ] || [ ! -s "$OUTPUT_FILE" ]; then
        echo "❌ Output file missing or empty"
        return 1
    fi

    # Type-specific validation
    case "$TASK_TYPE" in
        screening)
            grep -q "Overall Assessment" "$OUTPUT_FILE" && \
            grep -q "Recommendation" "$OUTPUT_FILE"
            ;;
        job_description)
            grep -q "Responsibilities" "$OUTPUT_FILE" && \
            grep -q "Required Qualifications" "$OUTPUT_FILE"
            ;;
        communication)
            grep -q "Subject:" "$OUTPUT_FILE" && \
            grep -q "Dear" "$OUTPUT_FILE"
            ;;
    esac

    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "✅ Validation passed"
        return 0
    else
        echo "❌ Output missing required sections"
        return 1
    fi
}

# Usage
validate_recruitment_output ".claude/recruitment/screenings/candidate.md" "screening"
```

This ensures quality before delivery.
