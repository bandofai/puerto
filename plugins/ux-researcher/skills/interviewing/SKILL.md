## Core Principles

1. **Listen More Than You Talk**: 80/20 rule - participant talks 80% of the time
2. **Be Genuinely Curious**: Approach with beginner's mind, not expert assumptions
3. **Focus on Past Behavior**: What users did is more reliable than what they say they'll do
4. **Create Psychological Safety**: Make participants comfortable sharing honestly
5. **Stay Neutral**: Your job is to learn, not validate your ideas

## Opening the Interview

### Welcome Script

**Greeting**
"Hi [Name], thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today."

**Introduction**
"My name is [Your Name], and I'm a [role] at [company/team]. I'm here to learn from you."

**Purpose**
"Today we're going to talk about [topic]. I want to understand your experiences with [area] so we can [benefit]. Your honest feedback is incredibly valuable."

**Duration**
"This will take about [X minutes]. I have some questions prepared, but feel free to share whatever you think is relevant."

**No Right Answers**
"There are no right or wrong answers. I'm not testing you—I'm learning from you. If something doesn't make sense or seems like a bad idea, that's exactly what I need to hear."

**Consent and Recording**
"Before we begin, I need your permission to record this conversation. The recording is only for our internal team to review and helps us capture your insights accurately. We won't share it publicly or attach your name to specific quotes. Is that okay?"

[ ] Verbal consent obtained
[ ] Recording started

**Questions Before We Begin?**
"Do you have any questions before we start?"

---

## Building Rapport

### Warm-Up Strategies

**Start Broad**
Begin with easy, non-threatening questions:
- "Tell me a bit about yourself"
- "What do you do day-to-day?"
- "How did you get into [field/job]?"

**Find Common Ground**
- Notice something in their background (on video) or from screener
- "I noticed you mentioned [X]—I'm curious about that"
- Genuine interest, not fake flattery

**Match Their Energy**
- If they're formal, stay professional
- If they're casual, relax your tone
- Mirror their pace and language

**Use Their Name**
- Occasionally use their first name naturally
- Shows attentiveness and personalizes conversation

**Be Human**
- Light humor is okay (if natural)
- Acknowledge shared experiences
- Don't be a robot reading questions

---

## Question Techniques

### Open-Ended Questions

**Structure**: Start with how, what, tell me, describe, walk me through

✅ **GOOD**:
- "Tell me about the last time you..."
- "How do you currently..."
- "Walk me through your process for..."
- "What goes through your mind when..."
- "Describe a situation where..."

❌ **BAD** (closed):
- "Do you like this?" (yes/no)
- "Is this confusing?" (yes/no)
- "Would you use this feature?" (yes/no)

---

### Behavioral Questions (Past Behavior)

**Principle**: Past behavior predicts future behavior better than hypotheticals

✅ **GOOD** (behavioral):
- "Tell me about the last time you tried to [task]"
- "Walk me through how you [accomplished goal] last week"
- "What did you do when [situation] happened?"
- "Describe a recent situation where you needed to [action]"

❌ **BAD** (hypothetical):
- "Would you use this feature?"
- "What would you do if...?"
- "Do you think you'd...?"

**Why**: People are terrible at predicting their own behavior. They'll tell you what they THINK they'll do (often aspirational) rather than what they actually do.

---

### Probing Questions (The Art of the Follow-Up)

**Purpose**: Go deeper, get specific examples, understand reasoning

**The 5 Why's**
Keep asking "why" to get to root motivations:
- User: "I prefer app A over app B"
- You: "Why do you prefer A?"
- User: "It's faster"
- You: "Why is speed important to you?"
- User: "My clients are waiting"
- You: "Why does that matter?"
- User: "I get paid based on volume"
- *Aha! Real motivation: economics, not UX preference*

**Get Specific**
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What exactly happened?"
- "Walk me through step-by-step"
- "What did you do first? Then what?"

**Clarify Meaning**
- "What do you mean by [term they used]?"
- "Tell me more about that"
- "I want to make sure I understand—you said [paraphrase]?"

**Explore Emotions**
- "How did you feel when that happened?"
- "What was going through your mind?"
- "How did that make you feel?"

**Compare and Contrast**
- "How is this different from [alternative]?"
- "How does this compare to your usual approach?"

**Challenge Politely** (when something doesn't add up)
- "Earlier you mentioned [X], but this seems different. Help me understand."
- "That's interesting—can you help me reconcile [contradiction]?"

---

### Avoid Leading Questions

Leading questions telegraph the "right" answer and bias responses.

❌ **BAD** (leading):
- "Don't you think this is confusing?"
- "This is frustrating, isn't it?"
- "Wouldn't you prefer X over Y?"
- "Most people find this difficult. Do you?"
- "This button is too small, right?"

✅ **GOOD** (neutral):
- "What are your thoughts on this?"
- "How was that experience for you?"
- "Which of these do you prefer, if any?"
- "What was your experience with this?"
- "What do you notice about this button?"

**Tip**: If you find yourself nodding while asking a question, it's probably leading.

---

### Avoid Compound Questions

Don't ask multiple questions at once—participants will usually answer only the last one.

❌ **BAD** (compound):
- "How often do you use this feature, what do you like about it, and when was the last time you used it?"
- "Tell me about your workflow and how you collaborate with your team and what tools you use."

✅ **GOOD** (one at a time):
- "How often do you use this feature?"
- [Wait for answer]
- "What do you like about it?"
- [Wait for answer]
- "When was the last time you used it?"

---

## Active Listening Techniques

### The Power of Silence

**Don't rush to fill silence**. Count to 5 (in your head) after participant stops talking.

Often participants are:
- Gathering their thoughts
- Deciding how much to share
- Processing the question

If you jump in too quickly, you cut off deeper insights.

**When to use silence**:
- After asking a question (let them think)
- After they finish an answer (they might add more)
- When they're emotional (give them space)

---

### Reflective Listening

**Technique**: Paraphrase what you heard to confirm understanding

**Format**: "So if I understand correctly, you [paraphrase]?"

**Benefits**:
- Shows you're listening
- Gives participant chance to correct misunderstandings
- Encourages them to elaborate

**Example**:
- Participant: "I usually just skip that step because it takes too long"
- You: "So you've found a workaround to avoid that step because it's too time-consuming?"
- Participant: "Exactly, and also because I don't think it's necessary for my use case"
- *[New information you wouldn't have gotten without reflecting back]*

---

### Non-Verbal Communication

**Your body language matters**:
- ✅ Maintain eye contact (not staring)
- ✅ Nod to show you're listening
- ✅ Lean slightly forward (engaged)
- ✅ Open posture (arms uncrossed)
- ❌ Crossing arms (defensive)
- ❌ Looking at phone/computer (distracted)
- ❌ Frowning or showing surprise (judging)

**For remote interviews**:
- Look at camera occasionally (simulates eye contact)
- Use minimal head nods (they can see you)
- Unmute to give verbal affirmations ("mm-hmm", "I see")
- Don't multitask—they can tell

---

## Handling Difficult Situations

### The Quiet Participant

**Symptoms**: Short answers, minimal elaboration

**Techniques**:
- Use more specific questions
- Share that there are no wrong answers (again)
- Ask about specific past events (easier to talk about)
- Embrace longer silences (don't rush them)
- "I want to make sure I understand fully—can you tell me more?"

**Example**:
- You: "How do you feel about this feature?"
- Them: "It's fine"
- You: [Silence, count to 5]
- You: "Can you tell me about a recent time you used it?"

---

### The Over-Talker

**Symptoms**: Long tangents, hard to get through questions

**Techniques**:
- Politely interrupt and redirect: "That's really helpful. I want to make sure we cover everything, so let me ask about [topic]..."
- Use time as excuse: "This is great—I want to hear more but I'm conscious of time. Can we shift to [topic]?"
- Ask closed questions occasionally to regain control
- Acknowledge their point before redirecting: "That makes sense. Related to that, I'm curious about..."

---

### The "I Don't Know" Response

**When they say "I don't know"**:

**Don't accept it immediately**—dig deeper:
- "If you had to guess?"
- "What would your ideal answer be?"
- "What comes to mind when you think about it?"
- "Can you think of a similar situation?"

**If they truly don't know**:
- That's okay! It's data (this topic isn't top of mind for them)
- Move on gracefully
- Note it—if many participants say "I don't know" to same question, it's revealing

---

### The Participant Who Wants to Design

**Symptoms**: "You should add [feature]", "Here's what I'd do..."

**Appreciate but redirect**:
- "That's an interesting idea. Help me understand—what problem would that solve for you?"
- "What need does that come from?"
- "Tell me about a situation where you'd use that"

**Remember**: Users are experts in their problems, not solutions. Your job is to understand the problem deeply.

---

### Emotional Participants

**If participant gets emotional** (frustrated, upset, angry):

**Acknowledge and validate**:
- "I can see this is frustrating for you"
- "That sounds really difficult"
- "I appreciate you sharing that"

**Give them space**:
- Pause recording if needed
- Take a break
- Ask if they want to continue

**Don't**:
- Dismiss their feelings ("It's not that bad")
- Defend the product/design
- Show discomfort with emotion
- Rush them past it

**Their emotion is valuable data**—it shows what matters to them.

---

## Specific Interview Types

### Contextual Inquiry (in their environment)

**Unique aspects**:
- Observe first, ask questions second
- "Show me, don't tell me"
- Ask about artifacts in environment ("What's this for?")
- Note workarounds and adaptations

**Example questions**:
- "Can you show me how you do [task]?"
- "Walk me through your typical process"
- "What's this sticky note for?"
- "Why do you keep [item] here?"

---

### Concept Testing Interviews

**Structure**:
- Start with context questions (their current approach)
- Show concept WITHOUT explanation
- "What do you think this is?"
- "What would you use this for?"
- "What questions does this raise?"
- Probe on reactions (positive and negative)

**Don't**:
- Explain the concept first (you'll bias their interpretation)
- Defend or justify design
- Ask "Do you like this?" (not actionable)

**Do**:
- Ask "How, if at all, would this fit into your [workflow/life]?"
- Ask "What concerns do you have?"
- Ask "What's missing?"

---

### Usability Test Interviews (think-aloud)

**Before tasks**:
- Explain think-aloud: "As you go through these tasks, please tell me what you're thinking, what you're looking at, what you're trying to do"
- Practice with simple task ("Please think aloud while you show me your email inbox")
- Remind: "We're testing the design, not you"

**During tasks**:
- Let them struggle (don't jump in to help immediately)
- If they go quiet: "What are you thinking?"
- If stuck: "What would you try next?" not "Click the button on the left"
- Minimal interruption—save questions for after task

**After tasks**:
- "How confident are you that you completed that correctly?"
- "What did you expect to happen when you [action]?"
- "Was anything confusing or unclear?"

---

## Note-Taking Strategies

### What to Capture

**Verbatim quotes** (especially powerful ones):
- Use quotation marks
- Mark with [P1], [P2] for participant attribution
- Capture exact wording for pain points, delights, confusions

**Behaviors and observations**:
- Non-verbal cues (frustration, confusion, delight)
- Workarounds and adaptations
- Errors or struggles
- What they pay attention to

**Your thoughts and hypotheses** (mark clearly as researcher notes):
- [Note: Possible theme emerging around...]
- [Hypothesis: This might relate to...]
- Keep separate from participant data

---

### Note-Taking Systems

**Two-column method**:
```
| Observations/Quotes | Themes/Analysis |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| "I always skip that step because it takes forever" [P1] | Time pressure |
| "I wish I could do this faster" [P2] | Efficiency need |
```

**Digital tools**:
- Shared Google Doc (if observer is taking notes)
- Notion, Airtable (for structured capture)
- Dovetail, Reframer (specialized research tools)

**During interview**:
- Quick notes, not full transcription (unless auto-transcribing)
- Mark timestamps for important moments (easier to find in recording)
- Use abbreviations and shorthand

**After interview** (immediately, while fresh):
- Flesh out abbreviated notes
- Add observations you didn't have time to write
- Note themes emerging
- Rate severity of issues (if usability test)

## Common Interview Mistakes

### 1. Talking Too Much
❌ **Mistake**: Interviewer talks more than participant
✅ **Fix**: 80/20 rule. If you're talking more than 20%, pause and ask open-ended questions

### 2. Jumping to Solutions Too Fast
❌ **Mistake**: User mentions problem, you immediately propose solution
✅ **Fix**: Understand problem deeply first. Ask follow-ups before brainstorming solutions

### 3. Asking Leading Questions
❌ **Mistake**: "This is confusing, right?"
✅ **Fix**: "What are your thoughts on this?"

### 4. Accepting Surface Answers
❌ **Mistake**: Participant says "I like it" and you move on
✅ **Fix**: "What specifically do you like?" "Why is that important to you?"

### 5. Skipping Warm-Up
❌ **Mistake**: Diving straight into tough questions
✅ **Fix**: Build rapport with easy questions first

### 6. Asking Hypothetical Questions
❌ **Mistake**: "Would you use this feature?"
✅ **Fix**: "Tell me about the last time you needed to [accomplish that goal]"

### 7. Defending the Design
❌ **Mistake**: "Actually, you can do that—you just click here"
✅ **Fix**: "Interesting, tell me more about what you expected"

### 8. Ignoring Non-Verbal Cues
❌ **Mistake**: Participant looks confused but you don't probe
✅ **Fix**: "I notice you paused there—what are you thinking?"

### 9. Multi-Tasking
❌ **Mistake**: Checking email during interview
✅ **Fix**: Be fully present. Close other tabs, silence phone

### 10. Not Pilot Testing
❌ **Mistake**: Going into first interview with untested guide
✅ **Fix**: Pilot with colleague to check timing and question clarity
