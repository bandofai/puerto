## Pricing Presentation Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Always show pricing in context of value delivered
✅ Include "Most Popular" badge on recommended tier
✅ Provide multiple payment options (annual, monthly, multi-year)
✅ Show ROI/payback period immediately
✅ Make comparison easy (side-by-side table)
✅ Highlight savings (annual vs. monthly, volume discounts)
✅ Be transparent (no hidden fees)

### DON'T:
❌ Show price without value context
❌ Use "starting at" language (sets low anchor)
❌ Hide total cost (make it obvious)
❌ Over-complicate pricing (keep it simple)
❌ Forget payment terms (Net 30, etc.)
❌ Omit what's included vs. add-ons

### Pricing Psychology

**Anchoring:** Show 3 tiers to anchor middle tier as "best value"

**Social Proof:** "Most Popular" badge drives 60-70% to that tier

**Value Framing:** "$X/month" feels smaller than "$Y/year" even if same

**Simplicity:** Complex pricing creates decision paralysis

**Transparency:** Hidden fees destroy trust

**ROI:** Always show return, not just cost
