## Rubric Design Checklist

When creating a rubric, ensure:

**Criteria**:
- [ ] Aligned with learning objectives
- [ ] Observable and measurable
- [ ] Focused on important aspects (not trivial)
- [ ] 4-6 criteria (not too many, not too few)
- [ ] Mutually exclusive (no overlap)

**Performance Levels**:
- [ ] Clear distinctions between levels
- [ ] 3-5 levels (4 is most common)
- [ ] Descriptive labels (not just numbers)
- [ ] Parallel structure across levels

**Descriptors**:
- [ ] Specific, concrete language
- [ ] Observable behaviors
- [ ] Positive phrasing (what IS present)
- [ ] Free from value judgments ("good," "poor")
- [ ] No vague terms ("adequate," "appropriate")
- [ ] Examples provided when helpful

**Overall**:
- [ ] Valid (measures what it should)
- [ ] Reliable (consistent scoring)
- [ ] Fair (no bias)
- [ ] Transparent (students understand expectations)
- [ ] Useful (provides actionable feedback)

## Tips for Using Rubrics Effectively

**Before Assignment**:
1. Share rubric with students when assignment is given
2. Explain what each level looks like
3. Show examples of work at different levels if possible
4. Answer questions about expectations

**During Grading**:
1. Score all students on one criterion before moving to next (for reliability)
2. Use rubric consistently across all students
3. Add specific comments explaining score
4. Note exemplary work to share as examples (with permission)

**After Grading**:
1. Return with feedback promptly
2. Discuss common patterns (class did well on X, struggled with Y)
3. Provide opportunity for revision if appropriate
4. Use results to improve instruction

**Continuous Improvement**:
1. Note if criteria need clarification
2. Adjust levels if too many students at one level
3. Update examples
4. Gather student feedback on clarity
