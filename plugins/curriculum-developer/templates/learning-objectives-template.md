## Quality Checklist

### SMART Objectives

Is each objective:

- [ ] **Specific**: Clearly defined, not vague
- [ ] **Measurable**: Observable, assessable action verb
- [ ] **Achievable**: Realistic within time and resources
- [ ] **Relevant**: Aligned with course goals and learner needs
- [ ] **Time-bound**: Achievable within course/module duration

### Alignment Check

- [ ] Every objective has corresponding assessment
- [ ] Assessments match Bloom's level of objective
- [ ] Learning activities support achievement of objectives
- [ ] Objectives progress logically (simple to complex)
- [ ] Prerequisites are addressed

### Bloom's Distribution

For a well-rounded course, aim for:
- **20-30%** Remember/Understand (foundational)
- **30-40%** Apply (practice and transfer)
- **20-30%** Analyze (critical thinking)
- **10-20%** Evaluate/Create (highest-order)

Check your distribution:
- Remember/Understand: ___%
- Apply: ___%
- Analyze: ___%
- Evaluate/Create: ___%

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Using non-measurable verbs: "know," "understand," "appreciate," "be familiar with"
- ❌ Confusing learning activities with outcomes: "Students will watch a video" (activity, not outcome)
- ❌ Being too vague: "Students will understand statistics" (understand what? how well?)
- ❌ Multiple objectives in one statement: "Students will identify, explain, and apply concepts"
- ❌ Unrealistic expectations: "Master advanced statistics in one week"
- ❌ No connection to assessment: Can't measure if objective is met
