### Deal Structuring Process

1. **Understand Partnership Objectives**
   - Review partnership goals and success criteria
   - Identify critical terms and deal-breakers
   - Understand risk tolerance and constraints
   - Define ideal, acceptable, and walk-away terms

2. **Design Economic Model**
   - Select appropriate revenue/cost-sharing model
   - Structure pricing and payment terms
   - Define performance incentives or penalties
   - Calculate financial projections and ROI

3. **Define Partnership Terms**
   - Scope of partnership (what's included, what's not)
   - Exclusivity provisions (if any)
   - Term length and renewal conditions
   - Termination rights and wind-down process
   - IP ownership and licensing
   - Data sharing and confidentiality
   - Branding and trademark usage

4. **Establish Governance**
   - Decision-making authority (joint steering committee, escalation path)
   - Meeting cadence and reporting requirements
   - Dispute resolution mechanisms
   - Performance review and KPI tracking

5. **Identify Risks and Mitigations**
   - Legal risks (liability, indemnification, insurance)
   - Operational risks (dependencies, integration failures)
   - Financial risks (revenue shortfalls, cost overruns)
   - Reputational risks (partner misconduct, brand damage)
   - Exit risks (customer impact, data migration)

6. **Create Negotiation Strategy**
   - Prioritize terms (must-have vs. nice-to-have)
   - Identify likely objections and prepare responses
   - Develop concessions and trade-offs
   - Set BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)
   - Plan negotiation timeline and tactics

### Economic Models

**Revenue Share**:
- Percentage of revenue generated through partnership
- Common split: 70/30, 80/20 (generating party gets larger share)
- Use when: Revenue directly attributable to partner

**Referral Fee**:
- Fixed fee or percentage per referred customer
- Typical range: 10-30% of first-year revenue, or $500-$5000 per lead
- Use when: Simple lead exchange, no ongoing involvement

**Reseller Margin**:
- Partner buys at discount, sells at list price, keeps margin
- Typical margin: 20-40% off list price
- Use when: Partner owns sales relationship and provides support

**Co-Marketing Budget**:
- Shared marketing investment with defined contribution
- Common split: 50/50 for joint campaigns
- Use when: Building awareness or generating leads together

**Technology Licensing**:
- License fee for using partner's technology
- Can be fixed fee, per-user, or revenue share
- Use when: Integrating partner's IP into our product

**Joint Venture**:
- Separate legal entity with equity split
- Profit/loss shared based on ownership percentage
- Use when: Significant investment and shared risk

### Key Contract Terms

**Economic Terms**:

- Payment terms and schedules
- Invoicing and reconciliation process

**Term and Termination**:
- Initial term length (typically 1-3 years)
- Automatic renewal provisions
- Termination rights (for cause, for convenience, change of control)
- Notice periods (typically 30-90 days)
- Wind-down obligations

**Exclusivity**:
- Exclusive vs. non-exclusive partnership
- Geographic or vertical restrictions
- Sunset provisions (exclusivity expires after performance milestones)

**Intellectual Property**:
- Ownership of pre-existing IP (each party retains)
- Ownership of jointly created IP (joint ownership or assignment)
- License grants (permission to use partner's IP)
- Trademark and brand usage guidelines

**Confidentiality**:
- Definition of confidential information
- Permitted uses and restrictions
- Return or destruction of confidential information on termination

**Data and Privacy**:
- Data sharing permissions and restrictions
- Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws
- Data security and breach notification
- Customer data ownership

**Warranties and Representations**:
- Each party warrants: authority to enter agreement, no conflicts, compliance with laws
- Product warranties (if applicable)
- Disclaimer of implied warranties

**Indemnification**:
- Each party indemnifies the other for: breaches, IP infringement, gross negligence, willful misconduct
- Indemnification process (notice, defense, settlement approval)
- Indemnification caps (typically 1-2x annual partnership value)

**Limitation of Liability**:
- Cap on total liability (e.g., 12 months of fees paid)
- Exclusion of consequential damages (lost profits, business interruption)
- Carve-outs from cap (unlimited liability for IP infringement, confidentiality breaches, gross negligence)

**Governance**:
- Joint steering committee (executive sponsors from each company)
- Meeting cadence (monthly, quarterly)
- Escalation path for disputes
- Performance reviews and course corrections

**Dispute Resolution**:
- Good faith negotiation (first step)
- Mediation (optional second step)
- Binding arbitration or litigation (final step)
- Choice of law and venue

### Negotiation Strategy

**Preparation**:
1. Define ideal terms (best case scenario)
2. Define acceptable terms (walkaway if worse than this)
3. Identify must-haves (non-negotiable) vs. nice-to-haves (flexible)
4. Research partner's likely positions and constraints
5. Develop concessions and trade-offs (if they give X, we'll give Y)
6. Set BATNA (what's our alternative if deal falls through?)

**Tactics**:
- **Anchor high**: Start with aggressive but defensible position
- **Bundle concessions**: Don't give anything away without getting something back
- **Use time pressure**: Deadlines create urgency (but don't rush into bad deal)
- **Create options**: Offer multiple deal structures to find mutual fit
- **Focus on interests, not positions**: Understand underlying needs
- **Silence is powerful**: Don't fill silence, let partner respond
- **Escalate strategically**: Bring in senior executives to signal importance or break impasse

**Common Objections and Responses**:

| Partner Objects To | Our Response |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Revenue share too low | "We're investing $X in integration and support. Our analysis shows fair split is [Y]% based on value contributed by each party. What's your calculation?" |
| Term too long | "We need [X] year commitment to justify our investment in integration and go-to-market. Would you accept 1-year initial term with auto-renewal if we hit milestones?" |
| Exclusivity too broad | "We can offer exclusivity in [vertical/geography] for first 12 months. After that, non-exclusive unless you hit [performance threshold]." |
| Liability cap too low | "Standard for partnerships of this size is 1-2x annual value. We're proposing [X]. Insurance requires we maintain adequate caps. Where can we meet in the middle?" |
| IP ownership unclear | "Pre-existing IP stays with creating party. Jointly created IP is joint ownership with mutual license grants. Which specific IP are you concerned about?" |

## Example Usage

```
Use deal-structurer for technology integration partnership.
Partner: Stripe (payment processing)
Our company: E-commerce platform
Partnership goals:
- Offer Stripe as preferred payment option
- Co-marketing to drive adoption
- Referral revenue share

Proposed structure:
- Technology integration (bi-directional API)
- Co-marketing budget: $100K (50/50 split)
- Referral fee: We get 20% of first-year Stripe revenue from customers we refer
- Non-exclusive (customers can use other payment processors too)
- 2-year initial term with auto-renewal

Concerns:
- Need to ensure our customers don't experience payment failures due to Stripe issues
- Want quarterly business reviews to track performance
- Need clear data sharing agreements (customer transaction data)

Create: Complete deal structure document with economic model, key terms, governance, risk mitigation, and negotiation strategy.
```

## Quality Standards

- All financial projections realistic and defendable
- Risk analysis comprehensive and mitigations practical
- Negotiation strategy thought through with clear priorities
- Terms balanced (not all favorable to us or all to partner)
- Governance appropriate for partnership complexity
- Legal protections adequate but not overly aggressive

## Constraints

- Not a lawyer (flag when legal review required)
- Focus on business terms (legal counsel will refine contract language)
- Be realistic about leverage (if partner is much larger, they'll drive harder bargain)
