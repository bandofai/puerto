## Partner Identification and Qualification

### Partnership Types

## Partnership Value Propositions

### Articulating Mutual Value

**Value for Partner** (Lead with this):
1. **Revenue Opportunity**: Specific, quantifiable revenue potential
   - "Access to our 1000 enterprise customers, 60% use solutions like yours"
   - "$500K estimated first-year revenue from cross-selling"
   - "20-30% increase in average deal size when bundled"

2. **Market Access**: New customers, geographies, or verticals
   - "Entry into financial services vertical (our strength)"
   - "50% of our customers in Asia-Pacific region"
   - "Direct access to Fortune 500 procurement contacts"

3. **Product Enhancement**: Improve partner's offering
   - "Our integration reduces partner's customer churn by 15%"
   - "Fill gap in partner's product suite (they lack X, we provide it)"
   - "Enable partner to compete for deals they currently lose"

4. **Brand Association**: Credibility and visibility
   - "Co-marketing with recognized leader in the space"
   - "Feature in our marketplace (10K monthly visitors)"
   - "Joint case study with Fortune 500 customer"

5. **Operational Efficiency**: Save time, reduce costs
   - "Automated workflows save partner's customers 10 hours/week"
   - "Reduce partner's support burden with self-service integration"
   - "Faster time-to-value for partner's customers"

**Value for Us**:
- Be transparent about what we gain
- Frame as mutual benefit (rising tide lifts all boats)
- Quantify where possible (not vague "brand exposure")

### Value Proposition Formula

**For [Partner Company]**: [Specific benefit 1], [Specific benefit 2], and [Specific benefit 3]
**For [Our Company]**: [What we gain]
**Together**: [Larger vision of what partnership enables]

Example:
"For Stripe: Access to 5000 e-commerce merchants (80% don't currently use Stripe), estimated $2M annual payment processing revenue, showcase integration in growing market.
For Us: Offer best-in-class payments (Stripe's brand and reliability), 5% revenue share on payment volume, co-marketing to Stripe's 100K+ customer base.
Together: Provide seamless e-commerce experience that helps merchants grow faster."

## Deal Structuring and Economics

### Revenue Share Models

**Percentage of Revenue**:
- Common splits: 70/30, 75/25, 80/20 (generating party gets larger share)
- Based on who "owns" customer relationship
- Who provides ongoing support and services
- Typical range: 15-30% to referring/supporting party

**When to use**:
- Revenue directly attributable to partner
- Long-term value (not just initial sale)
- Both parties have ongoing role

**Example**: SaaS reseller gets 25% of recurring revenue for customers they sell and support

**Tiered Revenue Share**:
- Higher percentage for first-year revenue (acquisition cost)
- Lower percentage for renewal/expansion (retention is easier)
- Example: 30% year 1, 20% year 2, 15% year 3+

**Referral Fee**:
- Flat fee or percentage of initial sale
- One-time payment for lead/customer introduction
- Typical: 10-30% of first-year revenue, or $500-$5000 per qualified lead
- Lower ongoing management overhead

**When to use**:
- Simple lead exchange
- Referring party has no ongoing role
- Clean attribution (clear who referred)

**Example**: Partner refers customer, gets $2000 referral fee, no ongoing involvement

**Reseller Margin**:
- Partner buys at discount, sells at (or near) list price
- Partner keeps margin as profit
- Typical margin: 20-40% depending on services partner provides

**When to use**:
- Partner owns end-customer relationship
- Partner provides sales, implementation, support
- You're the product/platform provider

**Example**: Partner buys software at 35% off list, sells at list price, keeps 35% margin

**Co-Marketing Budget Share**:
- Shared investment in marketing activities
- Common split: 50/50 for truly joint campaigns
- Can be asymmetric if one party benefits more (60/40, 70/30)

**When to use**:
- Building awareness or generating leads
- Both parties benefit from campaign
- Clear agreement on budget and deliverables

**Example**: $100K campaign budget, both companies contribute $50K, leads shared 50/50

### Contract Negotiation Strategies

**Preparation**:
1. **Define your BATNA** (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)
   - What's your plan if this deal doesn't happen?
   - Helps you know when to walk away
   - Strengthens negotiating position (you're not desperate)

2. **Set three positions**:
   - **Ideal**: Best case scenario (aggressive but defensible)
   - **Acceptable**: Walkaway line (minimum you'll accept)
   - **Walk-away**: Conditions where you'll end negotiation

3. **Prioritize terms**:
   - **Must-have**: Non-negotiable (deal-breakers)
   - **Important**: Flexible but valuable
   - **Nice-to-have**: Tradable for other concessions

4. **Research partner**:
   - What are their likely priorities and constraints?
   - What leverage do they have? What leverage do we have?
   - What similar deals have they done?

**Tactics**:

**Anchoring**: Start negotiations with your position (don't ask "what do you think?")
- Sets frame for discussion
- Partner negotiates from your starting point
- Be aggressive but defensible (not ridiculous)

**Bundling**: Trade concessions together, not individually
- "If you give us X, we'll give you Y and Z"
- Don't give anything without getting something back
- Create packages of concessions

**Creating Options**: Propose multiple deal structures
- Gives partner sense of control (choosing from options)
- All options acceptable to you
- Example: "Option A: Rev share. Option B: Flat fee. Option C: Hybrid"

**Time Pressure**: Deadlines create urgency
- "We need to finalize by end of quarter"
- "Competing proposal from [other partner] due next week"
- Don't manufacture fake urgency (damages credibility)

**Focus on Interests, Not Positions**:
- Position: "I want 30% rev share"
- Interest: "I need to cover my partnership team costs and show ROI"
- Ask "why?" to understand underlying interests
- Creative solutions often address interests better than positions

**Use Silence**: Don't fill every pause
- After making proposal, stop talking
- Let partner respond
- Resist urge to negotiate against yourself

**Good Cop / Bad Cop**: Use organizational dynamics
- "I'd love to agree, but my CFO/board won't approve less than X"
- Creates external constraint (not personal inflexibility)
- Gives you room to escalate for final concessions

### Key Contract Terms

**Term and Termination**:
- Initial term: 1-3 years typical
- Auto-renewal: Yes, with notice period (30-90 days)
- Termination for cause: Material breach, insolvency, fraud
- Termination for convenience: After initial term, with notice
- Wind-down: Customer transition, data handling, final payments

**Exclusivity**:
- Exclusive: Partner is only one in category/geography
- Non-exclusive: You can have multiple partners
- Limited exclusivity: Exclusive if partner meets performance thresholds
- Sunset: Exclusivity expires after timeframe or milestone

**Considerations**:
- Exclusivity limits your flexibility
- Partners want exclusivity to justify their investment
- Compromise: Time-limited, geography-limited, or performance-based

**Intellectual Property**:
- Pre-existing IP: Each party retains ownership
- Jointly created IP: Joint ownership or assignment to one party
- License grants: Permission to use partner's IP for partnership purposes
- Trademarks: Brand usage guidelines and approval process

**Red flags**:
- Partner claims ownership of your IP
- Overly broad license grants (can they use your IP for anything?)
- Perpetual licenses (prefer term-limited)

**Data and Privacy**:
- What data is shared between companies?
- How can each party use that data?
- Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws
- Data security and breach notification requirements
- Data deletion on termination

**Indemnification**:
- Each party indemnifies the other for:
  - Breaches of agreement
  - IP infringement
  - Gross negligence or willful misconduct
  - Violations of law
- Indemnification process: Notice, defense, settlement approval
- Caps on indemnity: Typically 1-2x annual partnership value

**Limitation of Liability**:
- Cap on total liability: 12 months of fees or $X, whichever is greater
- Exclusion of consequential damages: Lost profits, business interruption
- Carve-outs: Unlimited liability for IP infringement, confidentiality, gross negligence

**Example**: "Total liability capped at 12 months of fees paid or $500K, whichever is greater. No consequential damages. Unlimited liability for IP infringement and confidentiality breaches."
