## 3. Partnership Proposal

## 4. Deal Structuring

### Economic Models

Choose model based on partnership type and value exchange:

**Revenue Share**:
- Common split: 70/30, 75/25, 80/20 (generating party gets larger share)
- Use when: Revenue directly attributable, long-term value, ongoing role

**Referral Fee**:
- Flat fee or 10-30% of first-year revenue
- Use when: Simple lead exchange, no ongoing involvement

**Reseller Margin**:
- 20-40% discount from list price
- Use when: Partner owns customer relationship and provides support

**Co-Marketing Budget**:
- 50/50 split typical for joint campaigns
- Use when: Building awareness or generating leads together

### Contract Templates
- **Partnership agreement**: Master contract (see partnership-agreement-template.md)
- **Statement of work**: Specific projects or campaigns
- **Order form**: For reseller purchases
- **Amendment**: Modifications to existing agreement

### Key Terms Checklist
- [ ] Economic model and payment terms
- [ ] Term length and renewal conditions
- [ ] Exclusivity (exclusive, non-exclusive, limited)
- [ ] Intellectual property ownership and licenses
- [ ] Data sharing and privacy compliance
- [ ] Confidentiality obligations
- [ ] Indemnification and liability caps
- [ ] Termination rights and wind-down process
- [ ] Governance (steering committee, reviews)
- [ ] Dispute resolution

### Negotiation Guidelines

**Preparation**:
- Define BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)
- Set three positions: Ideal, Acceptable, Walk-away
- Prioritize: Must-have, Important, Nice-to-have
- Research partner's likely positions

**Tactics**:
- Anchor with your position first
- Bundle concessions (trade multiple items together)
- Create options (multiple acceptable deal structures)
- Focus on interests, not positions
- Use silence (don't fill every pause)

**Common Objections and Responses**:
| Partner Objects To | Our Response |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Revenue share too low | "Based on value each party contributes, fair split is X. What's your analysis?" |
| Term too long | "We need X-year commitment to justify investment. Alternative: 1-year with auto-renewal if targets met?" |
| Exclusivity too broad | "We can offer exclusivity in [limited scope] for [duration]. Performance-based beyond that." |
