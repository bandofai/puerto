## Birthday & Anniversary Tracking

### Database Structure

Maintain comprehensive contact records:

    {
      "id": "uuid-v4",
      "name": "Full Name",
      "nickname": "Preferred name",
      "relationship": "friend|family|colleague|acquaintance",
      "tier": "close|regular|occasional",
      "birthday": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "anniversary": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "interests": ["photography", "hiking", "cooking"],
      "preferences": {
        "giftStyle": "practical|experiential|luxury|handmade",
        "celebrationStyle": "intimate|social|no-fuss",
        "dietaryRestrictions": ["vegetarian", "gluten-free"],
