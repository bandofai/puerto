### Calorie Calculations

#### Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)

**Step 1: Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**
```
Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:

Men: BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) + 5
Women: BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) - 161

Example (35-year-old woman, 70kg, 165cm):
BMR = (10 × 70) + (6.25 × 165) - (5 × 35) - 161
BMR = 700 + 1031.25 - 175 - 161 = 1395 calories
```

**Step 2: Activity Multiplier**
- Sedentary (little/no exercise): BMR × 1.2
- Light (1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375
- Moderate (3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.55
- Very active (6-7 days/week): BMR × 1.725
- Extremely active (athlete): BMR × 1.9

**Step 3: Goal Adjustment**
- Maintenance: TDEE
- Weight loss: TDEE - 500 (lose 1 lb/week)
- Weight gain: TDEE + 300-500 (gain 0.5-1 lb/week)

#### Macro Distribution by Goal

**Standard Balanced Diet**
- Carbs: 45-65% (225-325g on 2000 cal)
- Protein: 10-35% (50-175g on 2000 cal)
- Fat: 20-35% (44-78g on 2000 cal)

**Weight Loss**
- Carbs: 40-45% (moderate)
- Protein: 30-35% (preserve muscle)
- Fat: 25-30%

**Muscle Gain**
- Carbs: 40-50% (energy for workouts)
- Protein: 25-35% (muscle synthesis)
- Fat: 20-30%

**Low-Carb/Keto**
- Carbs: 5-10% (<50g for ketosis)
- Protein: 20-25%
- Fat: 65-75%

### Portion Size Guidelines

#### Protein Portions
- Palm of hand = 3-4 oz cooked meat
- Deck of cards = 3 oz
- Checkbook = 3 oz fish fillet
- 2 eggs = 1 serving

#### Carbohydrate Portions
- Fist = 1 cup cooked rice/pasta
- Cupped hand = 1/2 cup grains
- Slice of bread = 1 oz (1 serving)
- Baseball = 1 medium fruit
- Tennis ball = 1/2 cup

#### Vegetable Portions
- Both hands cupped = 1 cup leafy greens
- Fist = 1 cup chopped vegetables
- Thumb = 1 oz cheese

#### Fat Portions
- Thumb tip = 1 tsp oil/butter
- Thumb = 1 oz nuts (1 serving)
- Golf ball = 2 Tbsp nut butter
- Dice = 1 oz cheese

## Meal Planning Methods

### Weekly Planning Strategies

#### Theme Nights
- **Monday**: Meatless (vegetarian/vegan)
- **Tuesday**: Taco/Mexican
- **Wednesday**: One-pot meals
- **Thursday**: Chicken dishes

- Chicken tacos + peppers + beans

#### Template Method
Create 5-7 meal templates, rotate proteins:

**Template 1: Grain Bowl**

## Best Practices

### Meal Planning Success

1. **Start simple**: Plan 3-4 dinners per week, not all 7
2. **Build a rotation**: 10-15 go-to meals, rotate through
3. **Theme nights**: Reduce decision fatigue
4. **Prep ahead**: Sunday prep sets up the week
5. **Keep it flexible**: Swap days if plans change
6. **Double recipes**: Freeze half for later
7. **Use leftovers intentionally**: Plan transformation meals
8. **Involve family**: Everyone chooses one meal
9. **Review weekly**: What worked, what didn't
10. **Keep emergency meals**: Frozen pizza, pasta, canned soup

### Nutrition Optimization

1. **Eat whole foods first**: Minimize processed foods
2. **Colorful plate**: Variety of vegetables ensures nutrients
3. **Protein at every meal**: Satiety and muscle maintenance
4. **Healthy fats**: Brain function, hormone production
5. **Fiber intake**: 25-38g daily for digestive health
6. **Stay hydrated**: Half body weight in ounces minimum
7. **Mindful portions**: Use hand method or measuring
8. **Limit added sugars**: <25g (women) or <36g (men) daily

3. **Slow cooker/Instant Pot**: Set and forget
4. **Batch cook**: Make larger quantities
5. **Pre-cut vegetables**: When time-limited

7. **Pre-washed greens**: Worth the cost
8. **Keep it simple**: Not every meal needs to be elaborate
9. **Frozen vegetables**: Nutritious, no prep, no waste
10. **Strategic shortcuts**: Store-bought sauce, pre-cooked rice

### Budget Tips

1. **Plan before shopping**: Avoid impulse purchases
2. **Use what you have**: Shop pantry first
3. **Buy in season**: Produce is cheaper and better
4. **Store brands**: Often same quality, lower price
5. **Buy whole**: Whole chicken cheaper than parts
6. **Reduce meat**: Beans and lentils stretch budget
7. **Grow herbs**: Easy and cost-effective
8. **Freeze extras**: Prevent food waste
9. **Cook at home**: Drastically cheaper than eating out
10. **Buy versatile ingredients**: Use in multiple meals
