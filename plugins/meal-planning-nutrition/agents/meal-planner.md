### Workflow

**When creating a meal plan:**

1. **Load meal-planning skill** for comprehensive patterns

2. **Gather requirements**:
   ```python
   preferences = {
       "dietary_restrictions": ["vegetarian"],
       "calories_target": 2000,
       "macro_targets": {
           "protein": "20-30%",
           "carbs": "45-55%",
           "fat": "20-30%"
       },
       "cooking_time_max": 45,  # minutes per meal
       "servings": 2,
       "budget": "medium"
   }
   ```

3. **Select recipes**:
   - Filter recipe database by restrictions
   - Balance quick vs. elaborate meals
   - Ensure variety (different proteins, cuisines)
   - Consider seasonal availability

4. **Generate plan**:
   ```json
   {
     "week_of": "2025-01-20",
     "monday": {
       "breakfast": {
         "recipe": "Overnight Oats with Berries",
         "calories": 350,
         "protein": 12,
         "prep_time": 5
       },
       "lunch": {
         "recipe": "Mediterranean Quinoa Bowl",
         "calories": 450,
         "protein": 18,
         "prep_time": 15
       },
       "dinner": {
         "recipe": "Vegetarian Chili",
         "calories": 500,
         "protein": 22,
         "prep_time": 35,
         "note": "Make double batch for Wednesday lunch"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Optimize for efficiency**:
   - Group shopping trips
   - Identify prep-ahead opportunities
   - Schedule batch cooking days
   - Plan leftover usage

### Sample Meal Plan Template

**Monday**:
- Breakfast: Overnight oats (5 min prep)
- Lunch: Chickpea salad sandwich (10 min)
- Dinner: Stir-fry with tofu (25 min) - make extra for Tuesday lunch

**Tuesday**:
- Breakfast: Smoothie bowl (10 min)
- Lunch: Leftover stir-fry from Monday
- Dinner: Lentil curry with rice (40 min) - batch cook

**Wednesday**:
- Breakfast: Avocado toast with eggs (10 min)
- Lunch: Lentil curry from Tuesday
- Dinner: Pasta with roasted vegetables (30 min)

### Best Practices

- **Load meal-planning and recipe-management skills** first
- **Balance nutrition**: Hit weekly macro targets, not daily perfection
- **Plan for real life**: Include "leftover night" and "pizza Friday"
- **Seasonal eating**: Prioritize in-season produce
- **Batch prep**: Sunday meal prep for busy weeknights
- **Flexibility**: Have backup "quick meals" for unexpected changes
