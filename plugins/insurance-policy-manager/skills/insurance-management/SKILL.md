- Life-event-driven updates

---

## Part 1: Policy Types and Coverage Standards

### 1.1 Health Insurance

**Coverage Types**:
- HMO (Health Maintenance Organization)
- PPO (Preferred Provider Organization)
- EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization)
- HDHP (High Deductible Health Plan) with HSA
- Medicare / Medicare Advantage
- Medicaid

**Key Metrics**:
```
Premium: Monthly payment amount
Deductible: Annual out-of-pocket before coverage
Out-of-Pocket Maximum: Annual maximum total cost
Copay: Fixed amount per service
Coinsurance: Percentage paid after deductible
Network: In-network vs out-of-network coverage
```

**Adequacy Standards**:
- Essential health benefits coverage (ACA minimum)
- Reasonable out-of-pocket maximum (<$9,100 individual, <$18,200 family)
- Prescription drug coverage
- Preventive care at no cost
- Network includes preferred providers

**Common Gaps**:
- No coverage (highest priority gap)
- High out-of-pocket maximums
- Limited prescription coverage
- Missing dental/vision coverage
- No HSA contribution strategy

### 1.2 Life Insurance

**Coverage Types**:
- Term Life (10, 20, 30 year terms)
- Whole Life (permanent with cash value)
- Universal Life (flexible permanent)
- Variable Life (investment component)
- Guaranteed Issue (no medical exam)

**Coverage Calculation Methods**:

**DIME Method** (most comprehensive):
```
D = Total Debt (excluding mortgage that pays off at death)
I = Income (10-15x annual income)
M = Mortgage balance
E = Education costs for children ($100k-$200k per child)

Total = D + I + M + E

Example:
Debt: $30,000
Income: $100,000 × 10 = $1,000,000
Mortgage: $250,000
Education: 2 children × $150,000 = $300,000
Total Recommended: $1,580,000
```

**Income Replacement Method**:
```
Annual Income × Years Needed
Example: $80,000 × 15 years = $1,200,000
```

**Human Life Value Method**:
```
(Annual Income - Expenses) × Years until retirement
Example: ($100,000 - $40,000) × 30 = $1,800,000
```

**Adequacy Standards**:
- Married with dependents: 10-15x annual income minimum
- Single with dependents: 5-10x annual income
- Single no dependents: Final expense coverage ($25k-$50k)
- Stay-at-home parent: $250k-$500k (replacement cost of services)

**Beneficiary Best Practices**:
- Primary beneficiary: spouse or children
- Contingent beneficiary: Always designate
- Per stirpes designation: For children (if one dies, goes to their children)
- Review annually and after life events
- Avoid naming minor children directly (use trust)
- Keep beneficiary info updated

**Common Gaps**:
- No life insurance with dependents (critical)
- Insufficient coverage (<5x income)
- Outdated beneficiary designations
- Only group coverage through employer (insufficient)
- No term life supplement

### 1.3 Disability Insurance

## Part 2: Coverage Analysis Frameworks

### 2.1 The DIME Method for Life Insurance

**Formula**:
```
D = Debt (all non-mortgage debt)
I = Income (10-15x annual income)
M = Mortgage balance
E = Education (college costs for children)
```

**Example Calculation**:
```
Profile:
- Age 35, married, 2 children (ages 5, 8)
- Annual income: $120,000
- Credit card debt: $10,000
- Car loans: $25,000
- Mortgage: $300,000
- College plans: 4 years public university per child

Calculation:
D = $10,000 + $25,000 = $35,000
I = $120,000 × 12 = $1,440,000 (using 12x for 35-year-old)
M = $300,000
E = 2 children × $150,000 = $300,000

Total Recommended Coverage: $2,075,000

Current coverage: $250,000 group policy through work
Gap: $1,825,000

Recommendation: Purchase $1.5M-$2M term life policy (20-30 year term)
Estimated cost: $50-$75/month for healthy 35-year-old
```

### 2.2 Income Replacement Method for Disability

**Formula**:
```
Monthly Benefit = (Monthly Gross Income × 0.60 to 0.70)

Waiting Period = Emergency Fund coverage period
```

**Example Calculation**:
```
Profile:
- Annual income: $90,000
- Monthly income: $7,500
- Emergency fund: 3 months expenses

Recommended Disability Coverage:
Monthly benefit: $7,500 × 0.65 = $4,875/month
Elimination period: 90 days (matches emergency fund)
Benefit period: To age 65
Own occupation definition: Yes

Current coverage: None
Gap: CRITICAL

Recommendation: Obtain individual LTD policy
Estimated cost: $150-$250/month (2-3% of income typical)
```

### 2.3 Asset Protection Method for Umbrella

**Formula**:
```
Recommended Coverage = Greater of:
1. Total liquid assets + home equity
2. 2-3× annual income for high earners
```

**Example Calculation**:
```
Profile:
- Annual income: $200,000
- Home value: $600,000
- Home equity: $300,000
- Investments: $400,000
- Savings: $100,000
- Total assets: $800,000

Calculation Method 1 (Assets):
Liquid assets + home equity = $800,000
Recommended: $1M umbrella

Calculation Method 2 (Income):
$200,000 × 2.5 = $500,000
Recommended: $1M umbrella (higher amount)

Current coverage: None
Gap: $1M

Recommendation: Purchase $1M-$2M umbrella policy
Prerequisites: Increase auto to 250/500/100, home to $500k liability
Estimated cost: $250-$400/year total
```

## Part 5: Common Insurance Mistakes

### 5.1 Underinsurance Risks

**Most Common Underinsurance Scenarios**:

```
1. Life insurance with dependents
   Mistake: $100k policy when need $1M
   Risk: Family financial devastation
   Fix: Use DIME method, buy term life immediately

2. Liability coverage at state minimums
   Mistake: 25/50/25 auto insurance
   Risk: Personal assets at risk in lawsuit
   Fix: Increase to 100/300/100 minimum + umbrella

3. Home replacement cost
   Mistake: Insuring for market value vs replacement cost
   Risk: Can't rebuild after total loss
   Fix: Get replacement cost estimate, update coverage

4. No disability insurance
   Mistake: Thinking "it won't happen to me"
   Risk: 1 in 4 workers become disabled before retirement
   Fix: Get LTD through employer or individual policy

5. No umbrella with high net worth
   Mistake: Adequate primary insurance but no umbrella
   Risk: Lawsuit exceeds primary limits, lose assets
   Fix: Buy $1M-$5M umbrella ($200-500/year)
```

### 5.2 Over-Insurance Waste

**Common Over-Insurance Scenarios**:

```
1. Unnecessary extended warranties
   Not insurance, usually bad value
   Self-insure small ticket items

2. Duplicate coverage
   Example: Both spouses have family health coverage
   Fix: One family plan, one individual or none

3. Collision on old vehicles
   If car worth <$3,000, drop collision
   Premiums + deductible may exceed payout

4. Life insurance on children
   Rarely needed (children aren't income earners)
   Exception: Final expense coverage for peace of mind

5. Credit life insurance
   Expensive, better to have proper term life
   Don't buy insurance through lenders
```

### 5.3 Documentation Failures

**Critical Documentation Mistakes**:

```
1. No home inventory
   Can't prove what was lost/stolen
   Solution: Video every room, keep off-site

2. Not keeping policy documents
   Can't reference coverage when needed
   Solution: Digital copies in cloud + physical copies

3. Missing beneficiary designations
   Asset goes to estate (probate, delays, costs)
   Solution: Name primary + contingent beneficiaries

4. Outdated beneficiaries
   Ex-spouse still listed as beneficiary
   Solution: Review annually, update after life events

5. No proof of ownership for valuables
   Can't prove value for claim
   Solution: Appraisals, receipts, photos with serial numbers

6. Not photographing damage immediately
   Delays claim, harder to prove extent
   Solution: Take photos/videos ASAP after incident
```

Best for: Satisfied with that company, convenience
```

**Direct/Online**:
```

## Part 8: Coverage Optimization Strategies

### 8.1 Deductible Strategy

**The Math of Deductibles**:

```
Example: Auto Insurance
- $250 deductible: $1,500/year premium
- $1,000 deductible: $1,100/year premium
- Annual savings: $400

Break-even analysis:
$750 increased deductible / $400 savings = 1.9 years

If you go more than 1.9 years without a claim, higher deductible saves money.

Strategy:
- Emergency fund >$1,000? → Use $1,000 deductible
- Emergency fund >$2,500? → Use $2,500 deductible (if offered)
- Save the premium difference → Build emergency fund faster
```

**When to Use Low Deductible**:
- Emergency fund insufficient
- High likelihood of claims
- Risk-averse personality
- Required by lender (home)

**When to Use High Deductible**:
- Strong emergency fund (6+ months)
- Good driving/claims history
- Willing to self-insure small claims
- Want to maximize savings

### 8.2 Multi-Policy Discounts

**Bundling Strategy**:

```
Typical Savings:
- Auto + Home: 15-25% on both
- Auto + Renters: 10-15%
- Auto + Life: 5-10%
- All policies with one company: 20-30%

How to Evaluate:
1. Get bundled quote
2. Get separate quotes from specialists
3. Compare total cost
4. Factor in convenience value

Sometimes individual policies from different companies are still cheaper
Shop both ways every 3-5 years
```

### 8.3 Self-Insurance Decision

**When to Self-Insure**:

```
Self-insure if:
1. Loss would not be financially devastating
2. You have emergency fund to cover
3. Premium cost high relative to coverage
4. Coverage provides little value

Examples of self-insurance:
- Extended warranties (bad value)
- Low-value items (<$1,000)
- Collision on old cars (<$3,000 value)
- Trip cancellation insurance (if can afford loss)
- Credit card insurance (use proper coverage instead)

Never self-insure:
- Health insurance (catastrophic risk)
- Liability (lawsuit risk unbounded)
- Home (if mortgage or can't afford rebuild)
- Life insurance (with dependents)
- Auto liability (legally required, huge risk)
```
