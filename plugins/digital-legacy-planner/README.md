✅ Cryptocurrency seed phrase locations (not the phrases!)

### What NEVER Gets Stored
❌ Actual passwords
❌ Cryptocurrency seed phrases (paper only!)
❌ Credit card numbers (full)
❌ Social Security numbers (full)
❌ Private encryption keys

### Encryption Requirements
- **All documents MUST be encrypted**
- Use AES-256 or equivalent
- Store decryption password separately
- Multiple secure copies recommended
- Test decryption process annually

### Safe Deposit Box Contents
- Master password (sealed envelope)

- **Creative Work**: Publish vs archive vs delete
- **Email**: Autoresponder message, archive preferences
- **Websites/Domains**: Maintain vs archive vs expire
- **Professional Accounts**: Client handoff, project transfers

## Legal Considerations

### United States
- Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (RUFADAA)
- State-specific digital estate laws
- Include digital executor language in will
- Service ToS may restrict transfers

### European Union
- GDPR right to erasure for deceased
- Country-specific inheritance laws
- Cross-border account considerations

### Recommendations
- Consult estate planning attorney
- Include explicit digital access authorization in will
- Understand platform-specific policies
- Consider jurisdiction of service providers

## Cryptocurrency Special Handling

⚠️ **CRITICAL IMPORTANCE**

Cryptocurrency requires extreme care:

1. **Seed Phrases**: Paper only, never digital
2. **Storage**: Fireproof safe or safe deposit box
3. **Testing**: Test recovery process before emergency
4. **Executor**: Must understand crypto basics
5. **Tax**: Consult accountant before transfers
6. **Professional Help**: Consider crypto estate specialist

**One mistake can lose funds permanently.**

## Update Schedule

### Annual Review (Minimum)
- Review account list (add/remove)
- Update passwords manager location if changed
- Verify backup locations accessible
- Update asset values
- Review memorial preferences
- Check executor still appropriate
- Test document access
- Update dates on all documents

### Immediate Updates Needed
- Major life changes (marriage, divorce, birth)
- New significant accounts (financial, crypto)
- Change of executor
- Change of password manager
- Move to new home
- New valuable digital assets
- Platform policy changes

## Workflow Integration

### With Other Plugins
- **Password Security Auditor**: Ensure strong passwords before inventory
- **Backup Automation Manager**: Verify backup strategy
- **Document Organizer**: Organize estate documents

### Standalone Usage
Each agent works independently for specific tasks

## Model Selection Rationale

- **account-inventory-builder**: Haiku (fast cataloging, deterministic)
- **access-instruction-writer**: Sonnet (sensitive decisions, nuanced guidance)
- **digital-asset-cataloger**: Haiku (fast inventory, structured output)

Cost-effective: ~90% savings using Haiku where appropriate while maintaining quality for sensitive decisions.

## Best Practices

### Do
✅ Update annually minimum
✅ Encrypt all documents
✅ Store multiple secure copies
✅ Test that executor can access
✅ Document 2FA recovery methods
✅ Use password manager
✅ Follow 3-2-1 backup rule
✅ Include executor in planning conversation

### Don't
❌ Store passwords in documents
❌ Skip encryption
❌ Forget to update after changes
❌ Store seed phrases digitally
❌ Make documents inaccessible
❌ Ignore 2FA implications
❌ Assume executor knows everything

## Troubleshooting

**Q: How do I handle cryptocurrency?**
A: Use digital-asset-cataloger with focus on crypto. Document wallet locations and seed phrase storage (paper only!). Consider professional help.

**Q: What if I don't have a password manager?**
A: Get one first (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass). Estate planning is much harder without it.

**Q: How do I encrypt the documents?**
A: Use VeraCrypt, GPG, or built-in OS encryption (FileVault, BitLocker). Store decryption instructions separately.

**Q: What if my executor isn't technical?**
A: The instructions are written for non-technical users with step-by-step guidance. Consider also designating a technical advisor.

**Q: How do I handle accounts with 2FA?**
A: Document backup codes, recovery methods, and authenticator app details. Consider emergency access features.

**Q: What about international accounts?**
A: Note jurisdiction for each account. May require legal proceedings in multiple countries. Consult international estate attorney.
