- 1 copy offsite (cloud or relative's house)

**Organization recommendations**:
- Folder structure: Year > Month > Event

- Hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
- Software wallets

## Security Best Practices

### Password Management
**Recommended approach**:
- Use password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass, Dashlane)
- Store master password in sealed envelope in safe deposit box
- Enable emergency access feature (if available)
- Document location of physical security keys (YubiKey)
- Provide backup codes separately

**What NOT to do**:
- ❌ Store passwords in plain text file
- ❌ Email passwords
- ❌ Use same password everywhere
- ❌ Store passwords in digital legacy document
- ❌ Save passwords in browser only

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
**Backup considerations**:
- Backup codes: Print and store with master password
- Authenticator apps: Document secret keys for re-setup
- Hardware keys: Physical location noted
- SMS backup number: Ensure executor can access
- Recovery email: Executor must have access

**Death/incapacity issues**:
- 2FA can lock executor out permanently
- Some services refuse account access even with death certificate if 2FA enabled
- Balance security vs accessibility
- Consider using 2FA methods that can be recovered

### Document Encryption
**Recommended approach**:
- Encrypt sensitive digital legacy documents
- Use standard encryption (AES-256)
- Password store in separate secure location
- Instructions for decryption with document
- Consider using VeraCrypt, GPG, or built-in OS encryption

**Decryption instructions must be**:
- Clear and step-by-step
- Stored separately from encrypted files
- Given to executor in sealed envelope
- Tested periodically

### Safe Deposit Box
**What to store**:
- Master password envelope
- Encrypted USB drive with documents
- 2FA backup codes
- Cryptocurrency seed phrases (paper)
- Decryption instructions
- List of account inventory locations
- Important contacts list

**Access considerations**:
- Ensure executor can access (joint access or authorized person)
- Bank requirements for access after death
- Contents may be sealed during probate (varies by state)
- Consider home safe as alternative/addition
