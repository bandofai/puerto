## Architecture Patterns Used

### 1. Skills-First Approach
All agents read the affiliate-marketing skill before execution:
```bash
if [ -f plugins/affiliate-manager/skills/affiliate-marketing.md ]; then
    cat plugins/affiliate-manager/skills/affiliate-marketing.md
fi
```

### 2. Model Selection Strategy
- **Sonnet** (3 agents): Strategic thinking, evaluation, pattern recognition
  - program-designer: Requires strategic planning
  - affiliate-recruiter: Needs evaluation judgment
  - fraud-detector: Complex pattern analysis

- **Haiku** (1 agent): Fast CRUD operations
  - commission-tracker: Deterministic calculations

### 3. Tool Permissions (Principle of Least Privilege)
- **Read-only** (fraud-detector): Read, Grep, Bash
  - Security: Cannot modify data, only analyze

- **Read-Write** (others): Read, Write, Edit, Bash
  - Appropriate for creation and tracking tasks

### 4. Data Structure Patterns
```
affiliate-data/
├── program-design.json
├── commission-structure.md
├── affiliates.json
├── sales-data.json
├── traffic-logs.json
├── commissions/
│   └── [period].json
├── payments/
│   └── [period].json
├── fraud-reports/
│   ├── [affiliate]-[date].md
│   ├── alerts/
│   └── risk-summary-[date].json
└── reports/
    ├── statements/
    └── executive-summary-[period].md
```

## Integration Workflow

### Complete Affiliate Program Lifecycle

```
1. PROGRAM DESIGN (program-designer)
   └─> Creates program structure, commission rates, tiers
   └─> Output: program-design.json, agreements, guidelines

2. RECRUITMENT (affiliate-recruiter)
   └─> Uses program details to recruit affiliates
   └─> Output: prospect lists, applications, onboarding sequences

3. ACTIVITY & TRACKING (commission-tracker)
   └─> Calculates commissions based on program rules
   └─> Output: payment batches, statements, reports

4. FRAUD MONITORING (fraud-detector)
   └─> Monitors all affiliate activity for fraud
   └─> Output: risk scores, investigation reports, suspensions
   └─> Feeds back to commission-tracker (hold payments)
```

### Agent Coordination Example

```bash
# Month-end workflow
@program-designer "review and update tier thresholds for Q2"
# Adjusts program based on performance

@commission-tracker "calculate commissions for March 2025"
# Generates payment batch

@fraud-detector "scan March activity for fraud"
# Identifies high-risk affiliates

# Manual review of fraud cases
# Approve payments for clean affiliates
# Hold payments for flagged affiliates

@affiliate-recruiter "recruit 50 new affiliates targeting [niche]"
# Replenish affiliate pool
```
