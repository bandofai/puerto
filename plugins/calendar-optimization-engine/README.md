- Many back-to-back meetings
- No dedicated deep work blocks
```

**Optimized Schedule**:
```
Monday:
  8am-10am: Deep work block (protected)
  10am-12pm: Meetings
  1pm-5pm: Project work with 2pm-3pm meeting window

Tuesday:
  8am-12pm: Deep work block (protected)
  1pm-3pm: Meetings
  3pm-5pm: Admin & email

Wednesday:
  8am-10am: Deep work block (protected)
  10am-12pm: Meetings (1:1s)
  1pm-5pm: Collaboration time

Result: 40% more focus time, 25% fewer meetings
```

### Example 2: Manager Schedule

**Current State**:
```
- 35 meetings/week (70% of time)
- No focus time
- Constant context switching
- Availability for team unclear
```

**Optimized Schedule**:
```
- Morning blocks (8-10am): Strategy & planning
- Meeting windows: 10am-12pm, 2pm-4pm
- 1:1 batching: Tuesday/Thursday afternoons
- Team availability: Daily 3-4pm
- Email time: 4-5pm daily

Result: 15 hours reclaimed, clearer boundaries
```

## Best Practices

### Calendar Hygiene

- **Buffer Time**: 15 minutes between meetings
- **Focus Blocks**: Minimum 2-hour uninterrupted blocks
- **Meeting Windows**: Batch meetings into specific time slots
- **Default No**: Decline meetings without clear agenda/purpose
- **Recurring Audit**: Review all recurring meetings quarterly

### Meeting Optimization

- **25/50 Rule**: Default to 25 or 50-minute meetings (not 30/60)
- **Attendee Minimum**: Only required people, make others optional
- **Agenda Required**: No agenda = no meeting
- **Async First**: Email/Slack for FYI items
- **Record Decisions**: Document outcomes immediately

### Time Blocking

- **Energy Alignment**: Deep work during peak energy hours
- **Theme Days**: Group similar work together
- **Context Preservation**: Minimize task switching
- **Proactive Blocking**: Schedule focus time first
- **Protect Ruthlessly**: Treat focus blocks as unmovable meetings

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Calendar sync failed"

**Solution**: Check API credentials and permissions:
```bash
# Google Calendar: Verify OAuth token
# Outlook: Check Microsoft Graph API permissions
# Ensure calendar read/write scope granted
```

### Issue: "Conflicts not detected"

**Solution**: Verify event data format:
- Check timezone information in events
- Ensure start/end times are properly parsed
- Validate event overlap logic

### Issue: "Analytics empty"

**Solution**: Ensure sufficient data:
- Import at least 2 weeks of calendar data
- Verify events have categories
- Check date range in analytics query

## Advanced Usage

### Automated Weekly Optimization

Schedule weekly calendar optimization:

```bash
# Every Sunday evening
"Analyze my calendar for next week and suggest optimizations"

# Workflow:
1. Import next week's events
2. Detect conflicts
3. Identify low-value meetings
4. Recommend focus time blocks
5. Generate implementation checklist
```

### Integration with Task Management

Combine calendar with task data:

```bash
"Block time for my top 3 priorities this week"

# Uses:
1. Task priority from task manager
2. Estimated time from task data
3. Energy requirements from task type
4. Creates optimal time blocks
```

### Team Calendar Coordination

Optimize team-wide calendars:

```bash
"Find best time for 5-person meeting next week"

# Analyzes:
1. All attendees' availability
2. Energy levels (avoid Friday afternoon)
3. Buffer time requirements
4. Timezone considerations
5. Suggests optimal slot
```
