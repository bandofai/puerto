# Translation Practices Skill

Professional translation methodologies, cultural localization, and quality assurance.

## Translation Methodologies

**Literal Translation**: Word-for-word (use sparingly, for technical/legal only)
**Dynamic Translation**: Meaning-for-meaning (preferred for most content)
**Adaptive Translation**: Cultural adaptation (for marketing/creative)

## Cultural Localization

- Adapt idioms to target culture
- Consider color symbolism (red = luck in China, danger in West)
- Number significance (4 = death in Japanese, 13 = unlucky in West)
- Date formats (MM/DD/YYYY vs DD/MM/YYYY vs YYYY-MM-DD)
- Currency formatting ($1,234.56 vs 1.234,56 â‚¬)
- Address formats vary by country

## Quality Framework

**Accuracy**: Translation matches source meaning
**Fluency**: Reads naturally in target language
**Terminology**: Consistent term usage
**Style**: Matches tone and register
**Cultural**: Appropriate for target market

## Best Practices

1. Read entire source before translating
2. Understand context and purpose
3. Use glossaries for consistency
4. Adapt cultural references
5. Review and revise
6. Native speaker review when possible

## Remember

Good translation is invisible - it reads as if originally written in the target language.
