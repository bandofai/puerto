## Key Metrics Explained

### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
**Formula**: `(Total AR / Total Credit Sales) × Number of Days`

**Interpretation**:
- <30 days: Excellent (customers paying quickly)
- 30-45 days: Good (typical for Net 30 terms)
- 45-60 days: Fair (some payment delays)
- >60 days: Poor (serious collection issues)

**Example**:
```
Total AR: $70,000
Credit Sales (last 90 days): $180,000
DSO = ($70,000 / $180,000) × 90 = 35 days ✅
```

### Collection Effectiveness Index (CEI)
**Formula**: `(Beginning AR + Credit Sales - Ending AR) / (Beginning AR + Credit Sales - Ending Current AR) × 100`

**Target**: ≥85% (excellent collections)

**Example**:
```
Beginning AR: $65,000
Credit Sales: $180,000
Ending AR: $70,000
Ending Current AR: $45,000
CEI = ($65,000 + $180,000 - $70,000) / ($65,000 + $180,000 - $45,000) × 100 = 87.5% ✅
```

### Payment Reliability Score (Customer)
**Formula**: `100 - penalties`

**Penalties**:
- On-time rate: `(1 - on_time_rate) × 40 points`
- Late average: `max((avg_days - terms_days) / 2, 30 points)`
- Disputes: `min(disputes × 10, 20 points)`
- Over credit limit: `10 points if utilization > 80%`

**Interpretation**:
- 80-100: Excellent (VIP customer)
- 60-79: Good (standard customer)
- 40-59: Fair (watch closely)
- 0-39: Poor (credit hold, tighten terms)

---

## Legal & Compliance

### GAAP Compliance

- **AR Valuation**: Report at net realizable value

**DO** ✅:

## Best Practices

### Invoice Generation
- ✅ **Use sequential numbering**: Easy tracking and audit compliance
- ✅ **Include all required fields**: Company info, customer, dates, line items, totals
- ✅ **Calculate tax accurately**: Verify jurisdiction and rates
- ✅ **Provide multiple payment methods**: Convenience improves payment speed
- ✅ **Set clear due dates**: Based on agreed payment terms
- ❌ Don't skip invoice numbers (creates audit gaps)

- ❌ Don't use vague line item descriptions

### Payment Tracking
- ✅ **Apply FIFO**: Oldest invoices first (industry standard)
- ✅ **Handle partial payments**: Update balances accurately
- ✅ **Reconcile to bank**: Match payments to bank deposits
- ✅ **Send confirmations**: Thank customers for payments
- ✅ **Update customer history**: Track reliability metrics
- ❌ Don't apply payments randomly
- ❌ Don't forget to update invoice status
- ❌ Don't skip payment confirmations

### Collections
- ✅ **Follow escalation timeline**: 7, 15, 30, 60, 90 days
- ✅ **Use professional language**: Even in final notices
- ✅ **Comply with FDCPA**: No threats, harassment, or 3rd party contact
- ✅ **Offer payment plans**: Before referring to collections
- ✅ **Document everything**: Keep copies of all communications
- ❌ Don't skip collection steps
- ❌ Don't threaten actions you won't take
- ❌ Don't contact customers outside business hours

### Aging Reports
- ✅ **Generate weekly**: Stay on top of receivables

- ✅ **Prioritize actions**: Focus on 60+ days first
- ✅ **Calculate DSO**: Monitor collection effectiveness
- ✅ **Compare to benchmarks**: Know your industry standards
- ❌ Don't ignore 90+ day buckets
- ❌ Don't let DSO trend upward without action
- ❌ Don't skip aged receivables review

### Customer Management
- ✅ **Track payment history**: Average days to pay, on-time rate
- ✅ **Calculate reliability scores**: 0-100 scoring system
- ✅ **Review credit limits**: Based on payment behavior
- ✅ **Implement credit holds**: For over-limit or 60+ days past due
- ✅ **Resolve disputes quickly**: Within 3-5 business days
- ❌ Don't extend credit without history
- ❌ Don't ignore repeated late payments
- ❌ Don't let disputes linger unresolved

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Invoice numbering out of sequence
**Solution**: Check `./invoices/.last_invoice_number` and manually update if needed

### Issue: Payment not applying correctly
**Solution**: Verify FIFO logic, check invoice status (already paid?), confirm amounts match

### Issue: Aging bucket calculation seems wrong
**Solution**: Verify invoice date vs. due date calculation method, check for timezone issues

### Issue: Collection email too aggressive for VIP customer
**Solution**: Customize template, extend grace period, or use friendly tone for all communications

### Issue: DSO calculation doesn't match expectations
**Solution**: Verify credit sales period (use 90 days or match your reporting period), check AR total accuracy

### Issue: Customer reliability score seems inaccurate
**Solution**: Review formula inputs (on-time rate, avg days, disputes), verify payment history data

### Issue: Tax calculation incorrect
**Solution**: Verify jurisdiction tax rate, check for local tax additions, confirm subtotal calculation
