### 1.2 Invoice Numbering Schemes

**Sequential** (Recommended):
```
INV-2025-0001
INV-2025-0002
INV-2025-0003
```

**Date-based**:
```
INV-20250120-001  (YYYYMMDD-sequence)
```

**Customer-based**:
```
INV-ACME-2025-001
INV-BETA-2025-001
```

**Best Practice**: Use sequential within year for easy tracking and audit compliance.

### 1.3 Payment Terms

| Term | Description | Calculation | Use Case |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Net 30** | Due in 30 days | Invoice date + 30 days | Standard B2B |
| **Net 15** | Due in 15 days | Invoice date + 15 days | Small purchases |
| **Due on Receipt** | Immediate payment | Invoice date | C-level, retail |
| **2/10 Net 30** | 2% discount if paid in 10 days, else due in 30 | Discount period: 10 days, Due: 30 days | Encourage fast payment |
| **1/15 Net 45** | 1% discount if paid in 15 days, else due in 45 days | Discount period: 15 days, Due: 45 days | Larger invoices |
| **EOM** | End of month | Last day of invoice month | Monthly billing cycles |
| **COD** | Cash on delivery | Before or at delivery | High-risk customers |

**Example Calculations**:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def calculate_due_date(invoice_date, terms):
    """Calculate invoice due date based on payment terms"""
    if terms == "Net 30":
        return invoice_date + timedelta(days=30)
    elif terms == "Net 15":
        return invoice_date + timedelta(days=15)
    elif terms == "Due on Receipt":
        return invoice_date
    elif terms == "2/10 Net 30":
        discount_date = invoice_date + timedelta(days=10)
        due_date = invoice_date + timedelta(days=30)
        return {"discount_date": discount_date, "due_date": due_date, "discount_pct": 0.02}
    elif terms == "EOM":
        # Last day of invoice month
        next_month = invoice_date.replace(day=28) + timedelta(days=4)
        return next_month - timedelta(days=next_month.day)

# Example
invoice_date = datetime(2025, 1, 20)
due_date = calculate_due_date(invoice_date, "Net 30")
# Result: February 19, 2025
```

### 1.4 Tax Calculations

**Sales Tax by Jurisdiction**:
```python
TAX_RATES = {
    "CA": 0.0725,  # California state sales tax
    "NY": 0.0400,  # New York state sales tax
    "TX": 0.0625,  # Texas state sales tax
    "WA": 0.0650,  # Washington state sales tax
    # Add local tax for specific cities
    "CA-SF": 0.0850,  # San Francisco (state + local)
    "NY-NYC": 0.08875,  # New York City
}

def calculate_tax(subtotal, jurisdiction):
    """Calculate sales tax based on jurisdiction"""
    tax_rate = TAX_RATES.get(jurisdiction, 0.0)
    return round(subtotal * tax_rate, 2)

# Example
subtotal = 1000.00
tax = calculate_tax(subtotal, "CA-SF")
# Result: $85.00
total = subtotal + tax
# Result: $1,085.00
```

**VAT (Value Added Tax)** for international:
```python
VAT_RATES = {
    "UK": 0.20,    # United Kingdom
    "DE": 0.19,    # Germany
    "FR": 0.20,    # France
    "IT": 0.22,    # Italy
    "ES": 0.21,    # Spain
}

def calculate_vat(subtotal, country):
    """Calculate VAT for international invoices"""
    vat_rate = VAT_RATES.get(country, 0.0)
    vat = round(subtotal * vat_rate, 2)
    return {"vat": vat, "rate": vat_rate, "total": subtotal + vat}
```

### 1.5 Line Item Calculations

**Formula**:
```
Line Item Amount = Quantity × Unit Price
Subtotal = Sum of all line items
Tax = Subtotal × Tax Rate
Total = Subtotal + Tax - Discounts + Shipping
```

**Example**:
```python
def calculate_invoice(line_items, tax_rate=0.0, discount=0.0, shipping=0.0):
    """Calculate invoice totals"""
    subtotal = sum(item['quantity'] * item['unit_price'] for item in line_items)
    discount_amount = subtotal * discount
    subtotal_after_discount = subtotal - discount_amount
    tax = subtotal_after_discount * tax_rate
    total = subtotal_after_discount + tax + shipping

    return {
        "subtotal": round(subtotal, 2),
        "discount": round(discount_amount, 2),
        "subtotal_after_discount": round(subtotal_after_discount, 2),
        "tax": round(tax, 2),
        "shipping": round(shipping, 2),
        "total": round(total, 2)
    }

# Example
line_items = [
    {"description": "Consulting Services", "quantity": 10, "unit_price": 150.00},
    {"description": "Software License", "quantity": 5, "unit_price": 200.00}
]

invoice = calculate_invoice(line_items, tax_rate=0.08, discount=0.10, shipping=25.00)
# Result:
# {
#   "subtotal": 2500.00,
#   "discount": 250.00,
#   "subtotal_after_discount": 2250.00,
#   "tax": 180.00,
#   "shipping": 25.00,
#   "total": 2455.00
# }
```

## Part 2: Payment Tracking

### 2.1 Payment Record Data Structure

**JSON Schema**:
```json
{
  "payment_id": "PMT-2025-0042",
  "invoice_id": "INV-2025-0015",
  "customer_id": "CUST-0042",
  "customer_name": "Beta Industries",
  "payment_date": "2025-01-28",
  "amount": 7519.05,
  "payment_method": "ACH",
  "reference_number": "ACH-20250128-001",
  "status": "cleared",
  "notes": "Early payment - 10% discount applied",
  "applied_to": [
    {
      "invoice_id": "INV-2025-0015",
      "amount": 7519.05,
      "applied_date": "2025-01-28"
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2025-01-28T14:30:00Z",
  "created_by": "system"
}
```

**Payment Status Workflow**:
```
received → pending → cleared → reconciled
                  ↓
              failed/bounced
```

### 2.2 Partial Payment Handling

**Scenario**: Customer pays $5,000 on a $7,519.05 invoice

```python
def apply_partial_payment(invoice, payment_amount):
    """Apply partial payment to invoice"""
    remaining_balance = invoice['total'] - invoice['paid_amount']

    if payment_amount >= remaining_balance:
        # Full payment
        invoice['paid_amount'] = invoice['total']
        invoice['status'] = "paid"
        invoice['balance'] = 0.00
        overpayment = payment_amount - remaining_balance
        if overpayment > 0:
            return {"status": "overpaid", "credit": overpayment}
    else:
        # Partial payment
        invoice['paid_amount'] += payment_amount
        invoice['balance'] = invoice['total'] - invoice['paid_amount']
        invoice['status'] = "partial"

    return invoice

# Example
invoice = {
    "invoice_id": "INV-2025-0015",
    "total": 7519.05,
    "paid_amount": 0.00,
    "balance": 7519.05,
    "status": "outstanding"
}

# First payment
apply_partial_payment(invoice, 5000.00)
# Result: balance = $2,519.05, status = "partial"

# Second payment
apply_partial_payment(invoice, 2519.05)
# Result: balance = $0.00, status = "paid"
```

**Partial Payment Policy**:
- Apply oldest invoices first (FIFO)
- Update aging buckets immediately
- Send confirmation with remaining balance
- Adjust collections workflow

### 2.3 Payment Methods

| Method | Processing Time | Fees | Reconciliation | Use Case |
|--------|----------------|------|----------------|----------|
| **Check** | 3-5 business days | $0 | Manual | Traditional B2B |
| **ACH** | 1-2 business days | $0.25-$1.50 | Automatic | Recurring payments |
| **Wire** | Same day | $15-$45 | Automatic | Large/urgent |
| **Credit Card** | 1-2 business days | 2.9% + $0.30 | Automatic | Small invoices |
| **Cash** | Immediate | $0 | Manual | Retail/COD |

**Reconciliation Tracking**:
```json
{
  "payment_id": "PMT-2025-0042",
  "payment_method": "ACH",
  "bank_transaction_id": "TXN-BANK-98765",
  "expected_date": "2025-01-28",
  "cleared_date": "2025-01-29",
  "reconciled": true,
  "reconciled_date": "2025-01-30",
  "reconciled_by": "jane_accountant"
}
```

### 2.4 Payment Application Order

**Best Practice**: FIFO (First In, First Out)

```python
def apply_payment_fifo(customer_invoices, payment_amount):
    """Apply payment to oldest invoices first"""
    # Sort by invoice date (oldest first)
    sorted_invoices = sorted(customer_invoices, key=lambda x: x['invoice_date'])

    remaining_payment = payment_amount
    applications = []

    for invoice in sorted_invoices:
        if remaining_payment <= 0:
            break

        balance = invoice['total'] - invoice['paid_amount']
        if balance <= 0:
            continue

        amount_to_apply = min(remaining_payment, balance)
        invoice['paid_amount'] += amount_to_apply
        invoice['balance'] = invoice['total'] - invoice['paid_amount']

        if invoice['balance'] == 0:
            invoice['status'] = "paid"
        else:
            invoice['status'] = "partial"

        applications.append({
            "invoice_id": invoice['invoice_id'],
            "amount_applied": amount_to_apply
        })

        remaining_payment -= amount_to_apply

    return {
        "applications": applications,
        "unapplied_amount": remaining_payment
    }

# Example
customer_invoices = [
    {"invoice_id": "INV-001", "invoice_date": "2025-01-01", "total": 1000, "paid_amount": 0},
    {"invoice_id": "INV-002", "invoice_date": "2025-01-15", "total": 2000, "paid_amount": 0},
    {"invoice_id": "INV-003", "invoice_date": "2025-01-20", "total": 1500, "paid_amount": 0}
]

result = apply_payment_fifo(customer_invoices, 2500.00)
# Result: INV-001 paid in full ($1000), INV-002 partial ($1500), INV-003 unpaid
```

### 3.4 Collections Automation

**Automatic Trigger Script**:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def get_collection_action(invoice):
    """Determine appropriate collection action based on invoice status"""
    due_date = datetime.strptime(invoice['due_date'], '%Y-%m-%d')
    today = datetime.now()
    days_past_due = (today - due_date).days

    # Check if already paid
    if invoice['status'] == 'paid':
        return {"action": "none", "reason": "Invoice is paid"}

    # Determine action based on days past due
    if days_past_due < -7:

## Part 4: Aging Reports

### 4.1 Aging Buckets

**Standard AR Aging Structure**:
```
Current (0-30 days from invoice date)
31-60 days
61-90 days
91-120 days
120+ days (seriously delinquent)
```

**Alternative Buckets** (from due date):
```
Current (not yet due)
1-30 days past due
31-60 days past due
61-90 days past due
90+ days past due
```

### 4.2 Aging Calculation

```python
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_aging_bucket(invoice_date_str, due_date_str=None, method="invoice_date"):
    """Calculate which aging bucket an invoice falls into"""
    today = datetime.now()

    if method == "invoice_date":
        reference_date = datetime.strptime(invoice_date_str, '%Y-%m-%d')
        days_old = (today - reference_date).days

        if days_old <= 30:
            return "Current (0-30)"
        elif days_old <= 60:
            return "31-60 days"
        elif days_old <= 90:
            return "61-90 days"
        elif days_old <= 120:
            return "91-120 days"
        else:
            return "120+ days"

    elif method == "due_date":
        due_date = datetime.strptime(due_date_str, '%Y-%m-%d')
        days_past_due = (today - due_date).days

        if days_past_due < 0:
            return "Current (Not Due)"
        elif days_past_due <= 30:
            return "1-30 days past due"
        elif days_past_due <= 60:
            return "31-60 days past due"
        elif days_past_due <= 90:
            return "61-90 days past due"
        else:
            return "90+ days past due"

# Example
bucket = calculate_aging_bucket("2024-11-20", "2024-12-20", method="due_date")
# Result: "31-60 days past due" (as of 2025-01-20)
```

### 4.3 Aging Report Generation

}
```

### 5.2 Payment History Tracking

**Metrics to Track**:

1. **Average Days to Pay**:
```python
def calculate_avg_days_to_pay(payments):
    """Calculate average days between invoice and payment"""
    days_list = []
    for payment in payments:
        invoice_date = datetime.strptime(payment['invoice_date'], '%Y-%m-%d')
        payment_date = datetime.strptime(payment['payment_date'], '%Y-%m-%d')
        days = (payment_date - invoice_date).days
        days_list.append(days)

    return sum(days_list) / len(days_list) if days_list else 0

# Example
avg = calculate_avg_days_to_pay(customer_payments)
# Result: 28.5 days (good for Net 30 terms)
```

2. **On-Time Payment Rate**:
```python
def calculate_on_time_rate(invoices):
    """Calculate percentage of invoices paid on time"""
    total = len(invoices)
    on_time = 0

    for invoice in invoices:
        if invoice['status'] == 'paid':
            due_date = datetime.strptime(invoice['due_date'], '%Y-%m-%d')
            paid_date = datetime.strptime(invoice['paid_date'], '%Y-%m-%d')
            if paid_date <= due_date:
                on_time += 1

    return (on_time / total * 100) if total > 0 else 0

# Example
rate = calculate_on_time_rate(customer_invoices)
# Result: 87.5% (fairly reliable customer)
```

3. **Payment Reliability Score** (0-100):
```python
def calculate_reliability_score(customer):
    """Calculate customer payment reliability score (0-100)"""
    score = 100

    # On-time rate (40 points)
    on_time_rate = customer['payment_history']['on_time_payment_rate']
    score -= (1 - on_time_rate) * 40

    # Average days to pay vs terms (30 points)
    avg_days = customer['payment_history']['average_days_to_pay']
    terms_days = 30  # Assuming Net 30
    if avg_days > terms_days:
        days_late = avg_days - terms_days
        score -= min(days_late / 2, 30)  # Max penalty 30 points

    # Disputes (20 points)
    disputes = customer['payment_history']['disputes']
    score -= min(disputes * 10, 20)  # -10 per dispute, max -20

    # Current balance vs credit limit (10 points)
    utilization = customer['credit_terms']['current_balance'] / customer['credit_terms']['credit_limit']
    if utilization > 0.8:
        score -= 10

    return max(0, score)

# Example
score = calculate_reliability_score(customer)
# Result: 85 (Good customer)
# 80-100: Excellent, 60-79: Good, 40-59: Fair, 0-39: Poor
```

### 5.3 Credit Limit Management

**Setting Credit Limits**:
```python
def calculate_credit_limit(customer_history, method="revenue_based"):
    """Calculate appropriate credit limit for customer"""

    if method == "revenue_based":
        # Credit limit = 2x average monthly revenue
        lifetime_revenue = customer_history['lifetime_revenue']
        months_active = customer_history['months_active']
        avg_monthly = lifetime_revenue / months_active if months_active > 0 else 0
        return round(avg_monthly * 2, 2)

    elif method == "reliability_based":
        # Base limit adjusted by reliability score
        base_limit = 10000.00
        reliability_score = customer_history['reliability_score']

        if reliability_score >= 80:
            return base_limit * 3.0  # $30,000
        elif reliability_score >= 60:
            return base_limit * 2.0  # $20,000
        elif reliability_score >= 40:
            return base_limit * 1.0  # $10,000
        else:
            return base_limit * 0.5  # $5,000

    elif method == "tiered":
        # Tiered based on relationship length and payment history
        months_active = customer_history['months_active']
        on_time_rate = customer_history['on_time_payment_rate']

        if months_active >= 24 and on_time_rate >= 0.9:
            return 50000.00  # Tier 1: Established, reliable
        elif months_active >= 12 and on_time_rate >= 0.8:
            return 25000.00  # Tier 2: Growing relationship
        elif months_active >= 6 and on_time_rate >= 0.7:
            return 10000.00  # Tier 3: New, decent history
        else:
            return 5000.00   # Tier 4: New or unreliable

# Example
credit_limit = calculate_credit_limit(customer, method="reliability_based")
# Result: $20,000 (reliability score 75)
```

**Credit Hold Logic**:
```python
def should_credit_hold(customer):
    """Determine if customer should be placed on credit hold"""
    reasons = []

    # Check 1: Over credit limit
    if customer['credit_terms']['current_balance'] > customer['credit_terms']['credit_limit']:
        reasons.append("Over credit limit")

    # Check 2: Invoices 60+ days past due
    overdue_60_plus = sum(1 for inv in customer['invoices']
                           if inv['days_past_due'] >= 60 and inv['status'] != 'paid')
    if overdue_60_plus > 0:
        reasons.append(f"{overdue_60_plus} invoices 60+ days past due")

    # Check 3: Total past due exceeds $5,000
    total_past_due = sum(inv['balance'] for inv in customer['invoices']
                          if inv['days_past_due'] > 0 and inv['status'] != 'paid')
    if total_past_due > 5000:
        reasons.append(f"${total_past_due:,.2f} total past due")

    # Check 4: Low reliability score
    if customer['payment_history']['reliability_score'] < 40:
        reasons.append("Low reliability score")

    return {
        "credit_hold": len(reasons) > 0,
        "reasons": reasons
    }

# Example
hold_status = should_credit_hold(customer)
# Result: {"credit_hold": True, "reasons": ["Over credit limit", "2 invoices 60+ days past due"]}
```

### 5.4 Dispute Tracking

**Dispute Record**:
```json
{
  "dispute_id": "DISP-2025-0005",
  "invoice_id": "INV-2025-0015",
  "customer_id": "CUST-0042",
  "dispute_date": "2025-01-25",
  "dispute_reason": "Services not rendered as described",
  "disputed_amount": 1200.00,
  "status": "under_review",
  "assigned_to": "jane_ar",
  "resolution": null,
  "resolution_date": null,
  "notes": [
    {
      "date": "2025-01-25",
      "user": "jane_ar",
      "note": "Customer claims consulting hours overstated. Reviewing timesheets."
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2025-01-25T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Dispute Resolution Workflow**:
```
1. Dispute logged → status: "under_review"
2. Investigation → gather evidence (contracts, timesheets, delivery receipts)
3. Customer communication → discuss findings
4. Resolution:
   a. Valid dispute → issue credit memo → status: "resolved_credit_issued"
   b. Invalid dispute → provide documentation → status: "resolved_no_adjustment"
   c. Partial validity → partial credit → status: "resolved_partial_credit"
5. Update customer record and invoice
```

## Part 7: Legal Compliance & Best Practices

### 7.1 GAAP Compliance

**Revenue Recognition** (ASC 606):
- Recognize revenue when performance obligation is satisfied
- Invoice when service is delivered or goods shipped
- Accrue unbilled revenue if service delivered but not yet invoiced
- Defer revenue if payment received but service not delivered

**Accounts Receivable Valuation**:
- Report AR at net realizable value
- Establish allowance for doubtful accounts
- Write off uncollectible accounts after exhausting collection efforts

**Allowance for Doubtful Accounts**:
```python
def calculate_allowance(ar_aging):
    """Calculate allowance for doubtful accounts based on aging"""
    allowance_rates = {
        "Current (0-30)": 0.01,     # 1% expected uncollectible
        "31-60 days": 0.05,          # 5%
        "61-90 days": 0.15,          # 15%
        "91-120 days": 0.30,         # 30%
        "120+ days": 0.75            # 75%
    }

    allowance = 0
    for bucket, amount in ar_aging['totals'].items():
        rate = allowance_rates.get(bucket, 0)
        allowance += amount * rate

    return round(allowance, 2)

# Example
allowance = calculate_allowance(aging_report)
# Result: $5,350 allowance on $70,000 total AR
# Net AR = $70,000 - $5,350 = $64,650
```

### 7.2 SOX Compliance

**Segregation of Duties**:
1. **Invoice Creation**: Sales/Billing team
2. **Payment Receipt**: Cash management team
3. **Payment Application**: AR team
4. **Reconciliation**: Accounting team
5. **Write-offs**: Finance manager approval required

**Audit Trail Requirements**:
- All AR transactions must be logged with timestamp and user
- Changes to invoices require approval and documentation
- Payment applications must be traceable to bank deposits
- Write-offs require dual approval (AR manager + CFO)

**Internal Controls**:
```json
{
  "control_id": "AR-001",
  "control_name": "Invoice approval over $10,000",
  "description": "All invoices over $10,000 require manager approval before sending",
  "frequency": "Per transaction",
  "owner": "AR Manager",
  "evidence": "Approval signature in system",
  "last_test_date": "2025-01-15",
  "test_result": "Passed"
}
```

### 7.3 Privacy and Data Protection

**PCI DSS Compliance** (if storing payment card data):
- Never store CVV/CVC codes
- Encrypt card numbers at rest
- Use tokenization for recurring payments
- Maintain PCI compliance certification

**GDPR Compliance** (for EU customers):
- Obtain consent for data processing
- Allow customers to access their data
- Provide data portability (export customer data)
- Honor "right to be forgotten" requests
- Notify customers of data breaches within 72 hours

**Data Retention**:
- **Active invoices**: Until paid + 7 years (IRS requirement)
- **Paid invoices**: 7 years minimum
- **Customer data**: While active + 7 years
- **Payment records**: 7 years (Sarbanes-Oxley)

## Part 8: Metrics & KPIs

### 8.1 Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)

**Formula**:
```
DSO = (Accounts Receivable / Total Credit Sales) × Number of Days
```

**Calculation**:
```python
def calculate_dso(total_ar, credit_sales_period_days, total_credit_sales):
    """Calculate Days Sales Outstanding"""
    dso = (total_ar / total_credit_sales) * period_days
    return round(dso, 1)

# Example
total_ar = 70000.00
credit_sales_last_90_days = 180000.00
dso = calculate_dso(total_ar, 90, credit_sales_last_90_days)
# Result: 35.0 days
```

**Interpretation**:
- **DSO < 30 days**: Excellent (customers paying quickly)
- **DSO 30-45 days**: Good (typical for Net 30 terms)
- **DSO 45-60 days**: Fair (some payment delays)
- **DSO > 60 days**: Poor (serious collection issues)

**Trend Analysis**:
```
Monitor DSO monthly:
- Increasing DSO → Collection effectiveness declining
- Decreasing DSO → Collection effectiveness improving
- Stable DSO → Consistent performance
```

### 8.2 Collection Effectiveness Index (CEI)

**Formula**:
```
CEI = (Beginning AR + Credit Sales - Ending AR) / (Beginning AR + Credit Sales - Ending Current AR) × 100
```

**Calculation**:
```python
def calculate_cei(beginning_ar, credit_sales, ending_ar, ending_current_ar):
    """Calculate Collection Effectiveness Index"""
    numerator = beginning_ar + credit_sales - ending_ar
    denominator = beginning_ar + credit_sales - ending_current_ar
    cei = (numerator / denominator * 100) if denominator != 0 else 0
    return round(cei, 1)

# Example
cei = calculate_cei(
    beginning_ar=65000,
    credit_sales=180000,
    ending_ar=70000,
    ending_current_ar=45000
)
# Result: 87.5%
```

**Interpretation**:
- **CEI ≥ 90%**: Excellent collections
- **CEI 80-89%**: Good collections
- **CEI 70-79%**: Fair collections
- **CEI < 70%**: Poor collections

### 8.3 Best Possible DSO (BPDSO)

**Formula**:
```
BPDSO = (Current AR / Total Credit Sales) × Number of Days
```

Represents DSO if all past-due invoices were collected immediately.

**Gap Analysis**:
```python
def calculate_dso_gap(actual_dso, best_possible_dso):
    """Calculate gap between actual and best possible DSO"""
    gap = actual_dso - best_possible_dso
    opportunity = f"Could improve cash flow by {gap:.1f} days"
    return {"gap": gap, "opportunity": opportunity}

# Example
gap = calculate_dso_gap(actual_dso=45, best_possible_dso=32)
# Result: {"gap": 13.0, "opportunity": "Could improve cash flow by 13.0 days"}
```

### 8.4 AR Turnover Ratio

**Formula**:
```
AR Turnover = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable
```

**Calculation**:
```python
def calculate_ar_turnover(net_credit_sales, beginning_ar, ending_ar):
    """Calculate AR turnover ratio"""
    avg_ar = (beginning_ar + ending_ar) / 2
    turnover = net_credit_sales / avg_ar if avg_ar != 0 else 0
    return round(turnover, 2)

# Example
turnover = calculate_ar_turnover(
    net_credit_sales=720000,  # Annual
    beginning_ar=65000,
    ending_ar=70000
)
# Result: 10.67 times per year
```

**Interpretation**:
- Higher turnover = Faster collections (better)
- Lower turnover = Slower collections (worse)
- **Good target**: 8-12 times per year (30-45 day DSO)

### 8.5 Bad Debt Ratio

**Formula**:
```
Bad Debt Ratio = (Bad Debt Write-offs / Total Credit Sales) × 100
```

**Calculation**:
```python
def calculate_bad_debt_ratio(bad_debt_writeoffs, total_credit_sales):
    """Calculate bad debt ratio"""
    ratio = (bad_debt_writeoffs / total_credit_sales * 100) if total_credit_sales != 0 else 0
    return round(ratio, 2)

# Example
ratio = calculate_bad_debt_ratio(
    bad_debt_writeoffs=3500,
    total_credit_sales=720000
)
# Result: 0.49% (acceptable - target <2%)
```

**Industry Benchmarks**:
- **<1%**: Excellent credit management
- **1-2%**: Acceptable
- **2-3%**: Fair (review credit policies)
- **>3%**: Poor (tighten credit policies)
