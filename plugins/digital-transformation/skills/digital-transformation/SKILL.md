## Part 3: Cloud Migration Strategies

### 3.1 The 6 R's of Cloud Migration

**Purpose**: Strategic approach to moving workloads to cloud

**1. Rehost** ("Lift and Shift")
- Move as-is to cloud
- Minimal changes
- Fast migration
- Use case: Urgent data center exit
- Effort: Low
- Benefit: Medium
- Example: VM to EC2

**2. Replatform** ("Lift, Tinker, and Shift")
- Minor optimizations
- Use cloud services
- No code changes
- Use case: Quick wins with some optimization
- Effort: Medium
- Benefit: Medium-High
- Example: Database to RDS

**3. Repurchase** ("Drop and Shop")
- Move to SaaS
- Replace custom with commercial
- Subscription model
- Use case: Non-differentiating systems
- Effort: Medium
- Benefit: High
- Example: On-prem email to Office 365

**4. Refactor** ("Re-architect")
- Cloud-native redesign
- Microservices, serverless
- Maximum cloud benefits
- Use case: Strategic applications
- Effort: High
- Benefit: Very High
- Example: Monolith to containers

**5. Retire**
- Decommission
- No longer needed
- Eliminate waste
- Use case: Redundant or unused systems
- Effort: Low
- Benefit: Cost savings
- Example: Shadow IT elimination

**6. Retain** ("Revisit")
- Keep on-premise (for now)
- Too risky/complex to move
- Not ready
- Use case: Highly customized, compliant systems
- Effort: None
- Benefit: Risk mitigation
- Example: Mainframe (temporarily)

**Migration Decision Matrix**:
```markdown
## Cloud Migration Strategy: Application Portfolio

| Application | Business Value | Technical Debt | Migration Strategy | Timeline | Effort | Cost Saving |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| ERP System | Critical | High | Repurchase (SaaS) | Q2 | Medium | 40% |
| Customer Portal | High | Medium | Refactor (Cloud-native) | Q3-Q4 | High | 30% + Agility |
| File Shares | Medium | Low | Replatform (Cloud storage) | Q1 | Low | 50% |
| Legacy CRM | Low | Very High | Retire | Q1 | Low | 100% |
| Email System | Medium | Medium | Repurchase (Office 365) | Q1 | Low | 35% |
| Analytics Platform | High | Low | Rehost (Lift & Shift) | Q2 | Low | 20% |
| Mainframe | Critical | Very High | Retain (Reassess 2025) | - | - | - |

**Migration Wave Plan**:
- **Wave 1 (Q1)**: Quick wins - Retire, Repurchase low-risk
- **Wave 2 (Q2)**: Volume move - Rehost, Replatform majority
- **Wave 3 (Q3-Q4)**: Strategic - Refactor key applications
- **Wave 4 (2025)**: Complex - Mainframe modernization

**Total Portfolio**: 45 applications
- Rehost: 15 apps (33%)
- Replatform: 10 apps (22%)
- Repurchase: 12 apps (27%)
- Refactor: 3 apps (7%)
- Retire: 5 apps (11%)
- Retain: 0 apps (0% - all migrated)

**Expected Benefits**:
- Cost reduction: 35% infrastructure costs
- Agility: 50% faster deployments
- Scalability: Elastic capacity
- Innovation: Modern stack enables AI/ML

### 5.2 Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis

**Purpose**: Compare on-premise vs. cloud over 5 years

**TCO Components**:

**On-Premise**:
- Hardware (servers, storage, network)
- Software licenses (perpetual)
- Data center (rent, power, cooling)
- IT staff (salaries, benefits)
- Maintenance and support
- Upgrades and refresh cycles
- Disaster recovery

**Cloud**:
- Subscription fees (compute, storage)
- Data transfer costs
- Cloud management tools
- Smaller IT staff (fewer admins)
- Training on cloud platforms
- Migration costs (one-time)

**TCO Example**:

## TCO Analysis: On-Premise vs. Cloud

### 5-Year Total Cost of Ownership

| Cost Category | On-Premise | Cloud | Savings |
|---------------|------------|-------|---------|
| **Year 0 (Initial)** | | | |
| Hardware purchase | $1.5M | $0 | $1.5M |
| Software licenses | $500K | $0 | $500K |
| Migration | $0 | $300K | -$300K |
| **Subtotal** | **$2.0M** | **$300K** | **$1.7M** |
| **Annual (Years 1-5)** | | | |
| Compute/servers | $200K | $400K | -$200K |
| Storage | $100K | $150K | -$50K |
| Network | $50K | $50K | $0 |
| Data center | $150K | $0 | $150K |
| IT staff (5 FTE) | $500K | $300K (3 FTE) | $200K |
| Maintenance | $200K | Included | $200K |
| **Annual Total** | **$1.2M** | **$900K** | **$300K/year** |
| **5-Year Total** | **$8.0M** | **$4.8M** | **$3.2M (40%)** |

**TCO Savings: $3.2M over 5 years (40% reduction)**

**Additional Cloud Benefits** (not in TCO):
- Scalability: Elastic capacity vs. fixed
- Agility: Deploy in minutes vs. weeks
- Innovation: Access to AI/ML, analytics
- Availability: 99.99% vs. 99.5%
- Security: Enterprise-grade vs. DIY

**Breakeven Point**: Month 18
