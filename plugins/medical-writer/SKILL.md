### Key Protocol Writing Principles

**Clarity and Precision:**
- Use active voice where appropriate
- Define all abbreviations at first use
- Specify exact doses, durations, routes (e.g., "500 mg orally once daily")
- Include units (mg, mL, days, weeks)

**Operationalization:**
- Make eligibility criteria measurable (e.g., "HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤10.0%" not "poorly controlled diabetes")
- Specify timing windows (e.g., "Week 12 visit: Day 84 ± 7 days")
- Define how outcomes will be measured (scale, instrument, assessor)

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- Follow ICH-E6 Good Clinical Practice guidelines
- Include required safety reporting elements (21 CFR 312 for IND)
- Ensure ethical oversight provisions

## Medical Manuscript Writing (IMRAD Format)

### IMRAD Structure

IMRAD = Introduction, Methods, Results, And Discussion

This universal structure facilitates efficient scientific communication and meets journal requirements.

### Manuscript Components

  - POOR: "A Study of Diabetes Treatment"

**2. Abstract (Structured: 250-300 words)**
```
Background: [Why study was needed - 2-3 sentences]
Methods: [Design, setting, participants, interventions, outcomes - 3-4 sentences]
Results: [Primary outcome, key secondary outcomes, adverse events - 3-4 sentences]
Conclusions: [Interpretation, clinical implications - 2 sentences]
Trial Registration: [ClinicalTrials.gov NCT number]
```

| Sufficient | Enough |
| Administer | Give |
| Adverse event | Side effect |
| Efficacy | How well it works |
| Pharmacokinetics | How the drug moves through your body |
| Contraindication | Should not use if |

**2. Use Active Voice**
- POOR: "The medication should be taken with food"
- GOOD: "Take your medication with food"

**3. Use Short Sentences (≤20 words)**
- POOR: "Patients who experience symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, or irregular heartbeat should immediately discontinue use and contact their healthcare provider"
- GOOD: "Stop taking the medication if you have these symptoms: trouble breathing, chest pain, or irregular heartbeat. Call your doctor right away."

**4. Use Lists and Bullets**
- Break up dense paragraphs
- Highlight key information
- Make scanning easier

**5. Use Headers and White Space**
- Chunk information logically
- Don't crowd the page
- Use meaningful headings

### Informed Consent Form Principles

**Key Requirements (21 CFR 50, ICH-GCP):**

1. **Basic Elements:**
   - Research nature of study
   - Study purpose
   - Expected duration of participation
   - Procedures to be followed
   - Experimental procedures

   - Short paragraphs and sentences

**Example Consent Language:**

POOR (Research-speak):
"You will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either the investigational product or placebo in a double-blinded manner for a period of 12 weeks."

GOOD (Plain language):
"You will be assigned by chance (like flipping a coin) to take either the study drug or placebo (an inactive pill). Neither you nor your study doctor will know which one you are taking. You will take the pills for 12 weeks."

## Medical Terminology and Style

### AMA Manual of Style (11th Edition) Key Points

**Abbreviations:**
- Define at first use
- Do not use in title or abstract
- Standard abbreviations do not need definition (DNA, HIV, FDA)
- Latin abbreviations in tables only (use "for example" not "eg" in text)

**Numbers:**
- Spell out numbers at start of sentence
- Use numerals for: ages, dates, measurements, statistical data
- "3 patients" but "three studies showed..."

**Units:**
- Always use metric (SI units)
- Space between number and unit (10 mg, not 10mg)
- Exception: percentages (10%, not 10 %)

**Hyphens:**
- Hyphenate compound modifiers: "placebo-controlled trial"
- Not after adverbs ending in -ly: "highly significant result"

**Drug Names:**
- Use generic names (lowercase)
- Brand names (capitalized) only if essential
- Specify dose, route, frequency

**Statistical Terms:**
- Italicize statistical symbols (p, t, F, r)
- Report exact p values (p=0.03, not p<0.05) unless p<0.001
- Always include 95% CI with point estimates
- Report effect size, not just significance

### Reference Formatting

**Vancouver Style (NLM):**
Most common in medical journals

Journal article:

```

**AMA Style:**
Used by JAMA and related journals (similar to Vancouver but slight differences)

## Evidence Grading and Critical Appraisal

### GRADE System (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)

**Quality of Evidence:**

HIGH ⊕⊕⊕⊕
- High confidence that true effect is close to estimated effect
- Typically from well-conducted RCTs

MODERATE ⊕⊕⊕○
- Moderate confidence in effect estimate
- May be downgraded RCTs or upgraded observational studies

LOW ⊕⊕○○
- Limited confidence in effect estimate
- Typically from observational studies or flawed RCTs

VERY LOW ⊕○○○
- Very little confidence in effect estimate
- From case series, expert opinion, or severely flawed studies

**Factors Decreasing Quality:**
1. Risk of bias (study limitations)
2. Inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity)
3. Indirectness (differences in population, intervention, outcome)
4. Imprecision (wide confidence intervals, few events)
5. Publication bias

**Factors Increasing Quality (for observational studies):**
1. Large magnitude of effect (RR >2 or <0.5)
2. Dose-response gradient
3. All plausible confounding would reduce effect

## Statistical Reporting Standards

### CONSORT Statistical Guidelines

**Sample Size Calculation:**
Must report:
- Primary endpoint used for calculation
- Assumptions (effect size, standard deviation, alpha, power)
- Method of calculation
- Adjustment for dropouts

Example:
"Sample size calculation was based on the primary endpoint of change in HbA1c at 12 weeks. Assuming a clinically meaningful difference of 0.5%, standard deviation of 1.2%, two-sided alpha of 0.05, and power of 80%, we required 90 patients per group. Accounting for 10% dropout, we planned to enroll 200 patients (100 per group)."

**Analysis Sets:**
- **ITT (Intention-to-Treat):** All randomized patients, analyzed as randomized
- **mITT (modified ITT):** Randomized patients with at least one post-baseline assessment
- **PP (Per-Protocol):** Patients who completed per protocol (sensitivity analysis)
- **Safety:** All patients who received at least one dose

**Missing Data:**
Report:
- Amount and pattern of missing data by group
- Reasons for missing data
- Method for handling (LOCF, MMRM, multiple imputation)
- Sensitivity analyses

**Multiplicity Adjustment:**
When testing multiple hypotheses, need to control Type I error
- Bonferroni correction
- Hochberg procedure
- Hierarchical testing (test secondary endpoints only if primary is significant)
