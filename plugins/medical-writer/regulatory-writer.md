### 2.5.3.2 Pharmacodynamics

[Summary of PK/PD relationships and target engagement]

**Mechanism-Based Pharmacodynamics**

[Product Name] [mechanism of action] results in [measurable PD effect: e.g., inhibition of enzyme X, receptor occupancy]. Study [XXX] evaluated the relationship between [Product Name] plasma concentrations and [PD marker] in [N] patients.

*Key Findings:*
- [Product Name] concentrations were significantly correlated with [PD marker] (r=[X], p<0.001)
- At the proposed dose of [X mg QD], median [PD marker] was [Y]% [increased/decreased] from baseline
- PD effect was sustained over the dosing interval (24 hours)
- The PK/PD relationship was [linear/Emax model]

**Exposure-Response for Efficacy**

Exposure-response analyses across Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies demonstrated that higher [Product Name] exposure (AUC or Cmax) was associated with greater efficacy (change in [primary endpoint]).

*Study 006 Exposure-Response:*
- Patients in the highest AUC quartile had [X]% greater improvement in [endpoint] compared to lowest quartile (p=0.015)
- No plateau in the exposure-response relationship was observed up to [Y] ng·h/mL AUC
- The proposed dose of [X mg QD] achieves exposures in the [2nd/3rd] quartile, balancing efficacy and safety

**Exposure-Response for Safety**

- The proposed dose of [X mg QD] provides an acceptable benefit-risk profile

[Detailed exposure-response analyses are presented in Module 2.7.2]

### 2.5.3.3 Intrinsic Factors

[Summary of PK in special populations: age, sex, race, organ impairment]

**Age**

Population PK analyses included patients aged [X-Y] years (mean [Z] years). Age was not a significant covariate on [Product Name] clearance. Elderly patients (≥65 years, N=[X]) had similar PK to younger patients. [No dose adjustment is needed based on age.]

**Sex**

[Product Name] clearance was [X]% [higher/lower] in females compared to males, after adjusting for body weight. This difference is not considered clinically significant. [No dose adjustment is needed based on sex.]

**Race/Ethnicity**

[Product Name] PK was similar across racial/ethnic groups studied ([White, Black, Asian, Hispanic]). [No dose adjustment is needed based on race.]

**Body Weight**

[Product Name] clearance increased with body weight, consistent with allometric scaling. However, weight-based dosing is not recommended because [rationale: e.g., fixed-dose achieved therapeutic concentrations across weight range studied].

**Renal Impairment**

Study [XXX] evaluated [Product Name] PK in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function.

*Results:*
| Renal Function | N | AUC GMR (90% CI) vs Normal |

- **Victim:** Substrate of CYP[X], CYP[Y], [transporter]
- **Perpetrator:** Inhibitor of CYP[X] (IC50 [Y] µM), inducer of CYP[Z]

Based on in vitro findings and clinical exposure, clinically significant DDIs are predicted with [specific drugs].

**Clinical DDI Studies**

| Study | Interacting Drug | Effect on [Product] AUC (90% CI) |
|-------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| XXX | Strong CYP3A inhibitor (ketoconazole) | 2.45 (2.12-2.83) |
| YYY | Strong CYP3A inducer (rifampin) | 0.32 (0.27-0.38) |
| ZZZ | OAT3 inhibitor (probenecid) | 1.68 (1.42-1.98) |

*Recommendations:*
- **Avoid concomitant use** with strong CYP3A inducers (may reduce [Product Name] efficacy)
- **Reduce [Product Name] dose** to [X mg QD] when co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors

## 2.5.4 OVERVIEW OF EFFICACY

[10-15 pages: High-level efficacy summary with focus on pivotal trials]

### 2.5.4.1 Disease and Endpoint Selection

**[Condition] as the Target Indication**

[Rationale for studying this indication, patient population]

**Primary Endpoint Rationale**

The primary efficacy endpoint for the pivotal trials was [endpoint description]. This endpoint was selected because:

1. **Clinical relevance:** [Endpoint directly measures clinically meaningful outcome / is a validated surrogate]
2. **Regulatory precedent:** [FDA has accepted this endpoint for other [drug class] approvals]
3. **FDA agreement:** FDA agreed this endpoint is acceptable (End-of-Phase 2 meeting, [Date])
4. **Measurement properties:** [Endpoint is objective, reliable, sensitive to change]

**Minimally Clinically Important Difference (MCID)**

Based on [literature, patient input, clinical judgment], a change of [X units] in [endpoint] is considered clinically meaningful. The pivotal trials were powered to detect this difference.

### 2.5.4.2 Phase 2 Dose-Finding Studies

[Summary of Phase 2 results informing Phase 3 dose selection]

**Study 005: Phase 2 Dose-Ranging Study**

*Design:* Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in [N] patients with [condition]. Patients received [Product Name] [X mg, Y mg, Z mg QD] or placebo for [duration].

*Primary Endpoint:* Change in [endpoint] from baseline to Week [X]

*Results:*

| Treatment | N | Baseline Mean (SD) | Week X Mean (SD) | Change LS Mean (SE) | Diff vs Placebo (95% CI) | P-value |
|-----------|---|--------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Placebo | 60 | 8.2 (0.9) | 7.8 (1.0) | -0.4 (0.1) | Reference | - |
| [Product] 25 mg | 60 | 8.3 (0.9) | 7.3 (1.1) | -1.0 (0.1) | -0.6 (-0.9, -0.3) | <0.001 |
| [Product] 50 mg | 60 | 8.2 (0.9) | 7.0 (1.0) | -1.2 (0.1) | -0.8 (-1.1, -0.5) | <0.001 |
| [Product] 100 mg | 60 | 8.1 (0.9) | 6.8 (1.0) | -1.3 (0.1) | -0.9 (-1.2, -0.6) | <0.001 |

*Dose Selection Rationale:*
All doses demonstrated statistically significant efficacy vs placebo. The 100 mg dose was selected for Phase 3 based on:
- Numerically greatest efficacy (though not statistically different from 50 mg)
- Acceptable safety profile similar to lower doses
- Exposure-response suggesting no plateau up to 100 mg dose
- FDA agreement (End-of-Phase 2 meeting)
