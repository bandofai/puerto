## Regulatory Writing Best Practices

### Language and Style

#### Precision
Use exact, unambiguous language:

❌ **Bad**: "The dose was given as needed."

✅ **Good**: "A single 50 mg dose was administered orally once daily at approximately 8:00 AM."

#### Quantitative Data
Always include:
- Units of measurement
- Precision appropriate to measurement
- Statistical context (n, mean, SD, range)

❌ **Bad**: "Blood pressure decreased."

✅ **Good**: "Systolic blood pressure decreased from 158.5 ± 10.2 mm Hg at baseline to 143.3 ± 11.5 mm Hg at Week 12 (n = 250; mean change: -15.2 mm Hg; 95% CI: -17.5 to -12.9; P < .001)."

#### Consistency
Use same terminology throughout:
- Drug name (pick one: generic, code, or trade)
- Abbreviations (define once, use consistently)
- Units (mg, not milligrams mixed)
- Endpoint names (exact wording each time)

#### Traceability
Link data to sources:
- "As shown in Module 5.3.5.1 (Study 101)"
- "CSR for Study XYZ (Module 5.3.5.1)"
- "See Section 2.7.3.4 for detailed analysis"

### Tables and Figures

#### Table Guidelines
- Numbered sequentially
- Descriptive title
- Column headers clear
- Units in headers
- Footnotes for abbreviations
- Data aligned appropriately (numeric right-aligned)

Example table structure:
```
Table 2.7.4.1: Summary of Common Adverse Events (≥2% in Any Treatment Group) - Safety Population

                        Drug X 50 mg   Drug X 100 mg   Placebo
Adverse Event           (N=250)        (N=250)         (N=250)
                        n (%)          n (%)           n (%)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Any adverse event       150 (60.0)     175 (70.0)      120 (48.0)
Headache                38 (15.2)      45 (18.0)       20 (8.0)
Dizziness               30 (12.0)      40 (16.0)       13 (5.2)
Nausea                  25 (10.0)      35 (14.0)       15 (6.0)
Fatigue                 20 (8.0)       30 (12.0)       18 (7.2)

Note: Percentages based on number of subjects in each treatment group.
MedDRA version 24.1 coding.
```

#### Figure Guidelines
- High resolution (minimum 300 dpi)
- Clear axis labels with units
- Legend included
- Color or grayscale appropriate
- Referenced in text

### Cross-Referencing

**Within document**:
"As discussed in Section 2.5.4..."

**Across modules**:
"Detailed study results are provided in Module 5.3.5.1, Clinical Study Report for Study 101."

**To external documents**:
"The protocol (see Module 5.3.5.1 Appendix) specified..."

### Version Control

Every document should have:
- Version number (1.0, 1.1, 2.0)
- Date
- Reason for revision (in subsequent versions)

Example footer:
```
Protocol XYZ-101 Version 3.0                                    15-Jan-2025
Confidential                                                    Page 25 of 84
```

## FDA/EMA Specific Considerations

### FDA Requirements
- eCTD format mandatory (electronic)
- Study data tabulation (SDTM) and analysis (ADaM) datasets
- Pediatric assessment required
- Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) if needed
- Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy designations if applicable

### EMA Requirements
- CTD format (can be electronic or paper historically, now eCTD)
- Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP)
- Risk Management Plan (RMP) more detailed than FDA
- Quality Review of Documents (QRD) template for label
- Centralized or decentralized procedure considerations

### ICH Guidelines Reference
Always cite which ICH guidelines followed:
- ICH E6(R2): GCP
- ICH E3: Clinical Study Reports
- ICH E9: Statistical Principles
- ICH M4: CTD Organization
- ICH Q series: Quality/CMC

## Output Format

Save document to: `regulatory/[submission-type]-[module]-[section].md`

Provide upon completion:
```
✓ Regulatory document created: [Title]
✓ Submission type: [IND/NDA/CTD Module X]
✓ Format: [FDA/EMA/ICH]
✓ Length: [XXX] pages
✓ Compliance:
  - ICH guidelines: [List]
  - FDA guidances: [List]
  - EMA guidelines: [List]
✓ Cross-references: [N] internal, [N] external
✓ Tables: [N]
✓ Figures: [N]
✓ Version: [X.X]
✓ Date: [Date]

Next steps:

- Regulatory review
- eCTD compilation
```

## Upon Completion

Provide:
- Document file path
- Submission type and module confirmation
- Compliance checklist
- Cross-reference summary
- Recommendations for quality control
- Next steps for submission preparation

## Common Regulatory Documents

### IND Documents
- Initial IND
- IND amendments (protocol, information, new investigator)
- Annual reports
- Safety reports (IND safety reports, DSURs)

### NDA/BLA Documents
- Original application (full CTD)
- Complete response to FDA questions
- Amendments during review
- Advisory committee briefing documents

### Post-Approval Documents
- Supplements (prior approval, changes being effected)
- Annual reports
- Periodic safety update reports (PSURs)
- Label updates

## Edge Cases

**If expedited pathway**:
- Fast Track: More frequent FDA meetings, rolling review
- Breakthrough Therapy: Intensive FDA guidance
- Priority Review: Shortened FDA review timeline
- Accelerated Approval: Surrogate endpoints, post-market commitments

**If orphan drug**:
- Orphan Drug Designation application
- Smaller population, different statistical considerations
- Humanitarian Device Exemption (if device)

**If pediatric**:
- Pediatric Study Plan (FDA) or PIP (EMA) required
- Pediatric formulation considerations
- Age-appropriate efficacy and safety

**If biosimilar**:
- Abbreviated pathway (351(k))
- Comparability studies to reference product
- Totality of evidence approach
- Switching and interchangeability data

**If generic (ANDA)**:
- Bioequivalence to reference product
- Abbreviated application
- Focus on quality and equivalence, not efficacy/safety

**If investigational device (IDE)**:
- Different format than IND
- Device-specific considerations
- Risk classification dependent
