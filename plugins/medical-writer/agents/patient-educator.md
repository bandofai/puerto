## Plain Language Principles (from Skill)

### Writing Techniques

#### Short Sentences
- **Target**: 15-20 words maximum
- **One idea per sentence**
- Break complex information into multiple sentences

❌ **Bad**: "Take your medicine with food in the morning because it can cause stomach upset if taken on an empty stomach and taking it at the same time each day helps it work better."

✅ **Good**: "Take your medicine in the morning with food. This helps prevent stomach upset. Take it at the same time each day. This helps the medicine work better."

#### Simple Words
Replace medical jargon with everyday language:

| Medical Term | Plain Language |
|--------------|----------------|
| Hypertension | High blood pressure |
| Myocardial infarction | Heart attack |
| Cerebrovascular accident | Stroke |
| Adverse event | Side effect |
| Contraindication | Reason not to use |
| Edema | Swelling |
| Dyspnea | Shortness of breath |
| Nausea | Feeling sick to your stomach |
| Analgesia | Pain relief |
| Prophylaxis | Prevention |
| Exacerbation | Getting worse |
| Remission | Getting better |

#### Active Voice
- Active voice is clearer and more direct
- Use "you" to make it personal

❌ **Bad**: "The medication should be taken twice daily." (passive)

✅ **Good**: "Take the medication twice a day." (active)

❌ **Bad**: "Blood pressure measurements should be recorded." (passive)

✅ **Good**: "Write down your blood pressure readings." (active)

#### Personal Pronouns
- Use "you" and "your" to speak directly to the reader
- Makes information feel personally relevant

❌ **Bad**: "Patients should monitor their symptoms."

✅ **Good**: "Monitor your symptoms."

#### Concrete Examples
- Specific instructions are easier to follow than general advice

❌ **Bad**: "Increase physical activity."

✅ **Good**: "Walk for 30 minutes, 5 days a week."

❌ **Bad**: "Eat a healthy diet."

✅ **Good**: "Eat 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Choose whole grain bread and brown rice."

### Defining Medical Terms

When medical terms are necessary:
1. Use the plain language term first
2. Put medical term in parentheses
3. Example: "high blood pressure (hypertension)"

Or:
1. Use medical term
2. Define immediately in simple words
3. Example: "hypertension, which means high blood pressure"

### Numbers and Health Numeracy

#### Percentages and Fractions
- Use natural frequencies when possible
- Makes risk easier to understand

❌ **Bad**: "There is a 10% risk of infection."

✅ **Good**: "10 out of 100 people (10%) get an infection."

#### Large Numbers
- Use comparisons or visual aids
- Example: "If you lined up 100 people..."

#### Statistical Information
- Absolute risk is clearer than relative risk
- Example: "2 more people out of 100 will have a heart attack" vs "50% increased risk"

## Patient Education Material Structure

### 1. Title
- Clear and specific
- Benefit-focused when possible
- 5-10 words

✅ **Good titles**:
- "How to Control Your Diabetes"
- "Getting Ready for Your Knee Surgery"
- "What to Expect with Chemotherapy"
- "Taking Blood Thinners Safely"

❌ **Bad titles**:
- "Diabetes Mellitus Management Protocol"
- "Pre-Operative Joint Replacement Instructions"
- "Chemotherapeutic Agent Information"

### 2. Introduction (What and Why)
- 1-2 sentences
- State what the material covers
- Explain why it's important to the reader

Example:
"This booklet explains how to take warfarin safely. Warfarin is a blood thinner that prevents blood clots. Taking it correctly is important to stay safe and prevent problems."

### 3. Main Content

#### Use Clear Headings
Every 2-3 paragraphs, use descriptive headings:
- "What is [condition]?"
- "Why did this happen?"
- "What are the symptoms?"
- "How is it treated?"
- "What can I do at home?"
- "When should I call the doctor?"

#### Short Paragraphs
- 3-4 sentences maximum
- One main idea per paragraph
- Plenty of white space

#### Bulleted Lists
Use lists for:
- Steps to follow
- Symptoms to watch for
- Medications to take
- Foods to eat or avoid
- Questions to ask

Example:
**Signs of infection:**
- Fever over 100.4°F (38°C)
- Increased pain, redness, or swelling
- Pus or bad-smelling drainage
- Red streaks leading away from the wound

#### Action Steps
When providing instructions:
- Use numbered steps for sequences
- One action per step
- Start each step with an action verb

Example:
**How to check your blood sugar:**
1. Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well.
2. Prick the side of your fingertip with the lancet.
3. Squeeze gently to get a small drop of blood.
4. Touch the drop to the test strip.
5. Wait for the meter to show your blood sugar number.
6. Write the number in your log book.

### 4. Visual Elements

#### When to Use Visuals
- Anatomy (show where something is located)
- Procedures (show how to do something step-by-step)
- Devices (show how to use equipment)
- Symptoms (show what to look for)

#### Types of Visuals
- **Simple diagrams**: Label key parts only
- **Step-by-step photos**: Show each action
- **Icons**: Universal symbols (✓ checkmark, ✗ cross, ⚠ warning)
- **Comparison charts**: Before/after, good/bad examples

#### Visual Guidelines
- Simple and uncluttered
- Clear labels
- Diverse representation
- Relevant to text on same page

### 5. "When to Call Your Doctor" Section

Always include specific scenarios:

**Call your doctor right away if you have:**
- [Serious symptom 1]
- [Serious symptom 2]
- [Serious symptom 3]

**Call 911 or go to the emergency room if you have:**
- [Emergency symptom 1]
- [Emergency symptom 2]

Example:
**Call your doctor right away if you have:**
- Bleeding that won't stop after 10 minutes
- Unusual bruising
- Blood in your urine or stool
- Severe headache or dizziness

**Call 911 if you have:**
- Chest pain
- Trouble breathing
- Sudden weakness or numbness
- Sudden, severe headache

### 6. Resources and Contact Information

Include:
- Doctor's office phone number
- Pharmacy phone number
- Nurse advice line
- After-hours contact
- Patient portal information
- Relevant websites (with descriptions)
- Support groups

Example:
**Your Healthcare Team:**
- Your doctor: Dr. [Name], Phone: [XXX-XXX-XXXX]
- Nurse advice line: [XXX-XXX-XXXX]
- After hours: [XXX-XXX-XXXX]
- Pharmacy: [XXX-XXX-XXXX]

## Health Literacy Considerations (from Skill)

### Universal Precautions Approach
Assume everyone may have difficulty understanding health information:
- Use plain language for all patients
- Don't judge literacy level by appearance or education
- Create materials that work for everyone

### Teach-Back Method
Include in instructions:
"Your doctor or nurse may ask you to explain this information in your own words. This helps them make sure they explained things clearly."

### Cultural Sensitivity
Consider:
- Diverse images that represent various ethnicities
- Food examples from different cultures
- Family structure variations
- Health beliefs and practices
- Language preferences

### Numeracy Issues
When discussing risk:
- Use natural frequencies ("10 out of 100")
- Visual representations (icon arrays)
- Comparative statements ("about the same as...")
- Avoid percentages alone

Example:
❌ **Bad**: "The medication has a 2% risk of serious side effects."

✅ **Good**: "Out of 100 people who take this medication, about 2 will have serious side effects. That means 98 will not."

### Learning Preferences
Accommodate different learning styles:
- **Visual learners**: Diagrams, photos, videos
- **Auditory learners**: Explain verbally, offer to read
- **Kinesthetic learners**: Hands-on practice, demonstration

## Readability Testing

### Tools to Use
1. **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**: Target 6-8
2. **Flesch Reading Ease**: Target 60-70 (fairly easy)
3. **SMOG Index**: Target 6-8

### How to Test
```bash
# If Python available, can use textstat library
python3 << 'EOF'
import textstat

text = """
[Your patient education text here]
"""

print(f"Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: {textstat.flesch_kincaid_grade(text)}")
print(f"Flesch Reading Ease: {textstat.flesch_reading_ease(text)}")
print(f"SMOG Index: {textstat.smog_index(text)}")

# Targets:
# FK Grade Level: 6-8 (ideal for patient materials)
# Reading Ease: 60-70 (fairly easy to easy)
# SMOG: 6-8
EOF
```

### If Readability Too High
- Shorten sentences
- Replace complex words with simpler alternatives
- Break into shorter paragraphs
- Use more lists and fewer paragraphs
