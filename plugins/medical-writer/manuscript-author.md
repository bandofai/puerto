## ABSTRACT

[Structured abstract: 250-350 words]

**Importance:** [1-2 sentences: Why is this question important? What is the knowledge gap?]

[Example: Type 2 diabetes affects 37 million Americans, yet current treatments achieve glycemic control in only 50% of patients. Novel therapeutic approaches are needed.]

**Objective:** [1 sentence: Clear statement of study aim]

[Example: To determine the efficacy and safety of Drug X compared with placebo in adults with type 2 diabetes.]

**Design, Setting, and Participants:** [2-3 sentences: Design, dates, sites, population, key criteria]

[Example: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 15 US sites from March 2022 to October 2023. Adults aged 18-75 years with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.0%-10.0%) on stable metformin were eligible. Of 523 screened, 200 were randomized.]

**Interventions:** [1-2 sentences: What groups received what treatments]

[Example: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive Drug X 100 mg orally once daily (n=100) or matching placebo (n=100) for 12 weeks.]

**Main Outcomes and Measures:** [1-2 sentences: Pre-specified primary and key secondary outcomes]

[Example: The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12. Secondary outcomes included fasting glucose, body weight, and safety measures.]

**Results:** [3-4 sentences: Key findings with numbers, effect sizes, p-values, CI]

[Example structure:
- Total enrolled and analyzed
- Baseline characteristics (mean age, % female, baseline primary outcome)
- Primary outcome results (both groups, difference, CI, p-value)
- Key secondary outcomes
- Safety summary]

[Example: Among 200 randomized patients (mean age 58 years; 48% female; mean baseline HbA1c 8.2%), 195 (98%) completed the trial. Mean HbA1c decreased by 1.2% in the Drug X group and 0.4% in the placebo group, with a between-group difference of 0.8% (95% CI: 0.5%-1.1%; P<0.001). Fasting glucose decreased by 32 mg/dL in the Drug X group vs 10 mg/dL in placebo (difference: 22 mg/dL; 95% CI: 12-32; P<0.001). Adverse events occurred in 45% of Drug X group vs 38% of placebo group, with no serious adverse events related to treatment.]

**Conclusions and Relevance:** [2 sentences: Interpretation and clinical implications]

[Example: Among adults with type 2 diabetes, Drug X 100 mg daily for 12 weeks resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c compared with placebo. These findings support further study of Drug X as a treatment option for type 2 diabetes.]

**Findings:** [1-2 sentences: Design and key result]

**Meaning:** [1 sentence: Clinical implication]

## INTRODUCTION

[Typically 2-3 paragraphs, ~500-750 words]

### Paragraph 1: Problem Statement and Disease Burden

[Establish the clinical problem]

[Disease/condition] affects [prevalence data]. The condition is associated with [morbidity/mortality data, economic burden, quality of life impact]. [Pathophysiology brief if relevant to intervention]. [Current treatment limitations].

**Example:**
Type 2 diabetes mellitus affects approximately 37 million adults in the United States and 537 million worldwide.[1,2] The disease is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, kidney disease, blindness, and premature death.[3] Despite availability of multiple glucose-lowering therapies, only 50% of patients with diabetes achieve recommended glycemic targets (HbA1c <7%).[4] Moreover, many current therapies are associated with hypoglycemia, weight gain, or gastrointestinal side effects, limiting their use.[5,6]

### Paragraph 2: Current State of Knowledge and Gaps

[What is already known? What's missing?]

[Existing treatments and their limitations]. [Previous research in this area and what it showed]. [What remains unknown or uncertain]. [How this gap affects patient care].

**Example:**
Current guidelines recommend metformin as first-line therapy, with addition of other agents if glycemic targets are not achieved.[7] Available options include sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors, each with distinct mechanisms and side effect profiles.[8] However, many patients remain inadequately controlled on these regimens or discontinue due to tolerability issues. Novel therapeutic targets are needed to expand treatment options, particularly for patients who cannot tolerate existing therapies or who require additional glycemic control.

### Paragraph 3: Study Rationale, Hypothesis, and Objectives

[Why this study? What does it add?]

[Intervention description and rationale]. [Hypothesis]. [Study objective clearly stated].

**Example:**
Drug X is a novel [mechanism of action] that showed promising glucose-lowering effects in preclinical models and Phase 1 studies.[9,10] Unlike existing therapies, Drug X does not cause hypoglycemia in preclinical studies and was well tolerated in healthy volunteers.[10] We hypothesized that Drug X would provide clinically meaningful HbA1c reduction compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. The objective of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Drug X 100 mg once daily compared with placebo in adults with type 2 diabetes.

## METHODS

[Detailed but concise - enough for replication]

### Study Design

[First paragraph: Overview]

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted at [number] sites in [countries/regions] from [start date] to [end date]. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each site and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ([NCT number]) before enrollment. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All participants provided written informed consent. [Note if protocol is publicly available and where].

**Example:**
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted at 15 centers in the United States from March 2022 to October 2023. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each participating site and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT0XXXXXX) on February 15, 2022. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All participants provided written informed consent. The full protocol is available in Supplement 1.

### Participants

[Detailed eligibility criteria]

**Inclusion criteria** included: [list key criteria]
- Age [range]
- Diagnosis of [condition] per [criteria/definition]
- [Disease severity thresholds]
- [Stability requirements]

**Exclusion criteria** included: [list key exclusions]
- [Contraindications]
- [Significant comorbidities]
- [Laboratory exclusions]
- [Prohibited medications]

[Complete criteria available in protocol/supplement]

**Example:**
Adults aged 18 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus were eligible. Key inclusion criteria included: (1) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months; (2) HbA1c between 7.0% and 10.0% at screening; (3) treatment with stable-dose metformin (≥1500 mg/day) for at least 8 weeks before screening; and (4) body mass index between 25 and 40. Key exclusion criteria included: type 1 diabetes; estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m²; alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal; myocardial infarction within 6 months; and use of insulin or other glucose-lowering medications (other than metformin) within 8 weeks. Complete eligibility criteria are provided in the protocol (Supplement 1).

### Randomization and Blinding

[How randomization was performed and concealed]

Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive Drug X or placebo using a computer-generated randomization schedule [with/without stratification by: site, baseline severity, etc.]. Randomization was performed using an interactive web-based system that concealed allocation until assignment. [Who was blinded: patients, investigators, outcome assessors, statisticians]. Study drug and placebo were identical in appearance. [Emergency unblinding procedures if applicable].

**Example:**
Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive Drug X 100 mg or matching placebo using a computer-generated randomization schedule stratified by site and baseline HbA1c (<8.5% vs ≥8.5%). Randomization was performed using an interactive web response system that concealed treatment allocation. Participants, investigators, site personnel, and outcome assessors remained blinded throughout the study. Emergency unblinding was available 24/7 through the interactive system but was not required for any participant.

### Interventions

[Detailed description of what each group received]

**Drug X group:** [Detailed intervention description]
- Dose, formulation, route
- Frequency and timing of administration
- Duration of treatment
- Instructions for administration (with food, time of day, etc.)

**Placebo group:** [Placebo description]
- Matched appearance
- Same administration schedule

**Concomitant medications:** [What was allowed/prohibited]

**Example:**
Participants randomized to Drug X received 100 mg once daily as a single oral tablet taken in the morning with breakfast. Those randomized to placebo received an identical-appearing tablet on the same schedule. Treatment duration was 12 weeks. Participants continued their stable metformin dose throughout the study. Rescue therapy with additional glucose-lowering medications was permitted if fasting glucose exceeded 270 mg/dL on 2 consecutive measurements; these participants continued in the study for safety follow-up. Use of other glucose-lowering medications, systemic corticosteroids, or weight loss medications was prohibited.

### Outcomes

[Clearly defined outcomes with measurement methods and timing]

#### Primary Outcome

The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12. HbA1c was measured at a central laboratory using high-performance liquid chromatography (Bio-Rad Variant II Turbo). The minimally clinically important difference was pre-specified as 0.5% based on prior research.[11]

#### Secondary Outcomes

Secondary efficacy outcomes included:
1. [Outcome 1]: [Definition, measurement method, timing]
2. [Outcome 2]: [Definition, measurement method, timing]

Secondary safety outcomes included:
- Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events
- Incidence of serious adverse events
- Incidence of hypoglycemia (blood glucose <70 mg/dL)
- Changes from baseline in [vital signs, laboratory parameters, ECG findings]

**Example of detailed secondary outcome:**
Change in fasting plasma glucose from baseline to week 12, measured after an 8-hour fast at the same central laboratory using enzymatic assay.

### Study Procedures

[Visit schedule and assessments]

Participants attended clinic visits at baseline (randomization), weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 (end of treatment), and week 16 (follow-up). At each visit, [assessments performed: physical exam, vital signs, laboratory tests, adverse event assessment, medication compliance check]. [Specific procedures: ECGs, special tests]. [Time windows: e.g., week 12 visit was Day 84 ± 7 days].

### Sample Size

[Calculation with assumptions]

The sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint of change in HbA1c at week 12. Assuming a between-group difference of 0.5%, standard deviation of 1.2%, 2-sided alpha of 0.05, and power of 80%, we calculated that 90 participants per group were needed. Accounting for 10% dropout, we planned to enroll 200 participants (100 per group). [Method: t-test or ANCOVA as appropriate].

### Statistical Analysis

[Pre-specified analysis plan]

The primary analysis was conducted in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized participants) according to the pre-specified statistical analysis plan. The primary endpoint (change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12) was analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group as a fixed effect and baseline HbA1c as a covariate. The treatment difference (least squares mean difference) and 95% CI were estimated. A 2-sided P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.

**Missing data** for the primary analysis were handled using mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) including all available data from weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, assuming data were missing at random. Sensitivity analyses used [last observation carried forward, multiple imputation, per-protocol analysis].

**Secondary outcomes** were tested hierarchically in the following order to control for type I error: [list in order]. Subsequent tests were considered exploratory if a prior test was not significant.

**Safety outcomes** were analyzed in the safety population (all participants who received ≥1 dose of study drug) and summarized descriptively.

**Subgroup analyses** (exploratory) evaluated the primary outcome by baseline HbA1c (<8.5% vs ≥8.5%), age (<65 vs ≥65 years), sex, and race/ethnicity using ANCOVA with treatment-by-subgroup interaction terms.

All analyses were performed using SAS version [X.X] (SAS Institute) [or R version X.X]. [Note if independent statistician conducted analyses].

### Participant Flow and Baseline Characteristics

[CONSORT diagram reference]

Figure 1 shows the flow of participants through the study. Between [dates], [X] individuals were screened and [Y] were randomized (Drug X: n=[A], placebo: n=[B]). [Completion rates]. [Reasons for discontinuation]. [Population analyzed: ITT, safety].

**Example:**
Figure 1 shows the flow of participants through the trial. Between March 2022 and June 2023, 523 individuals were screened, of whom 200 met eligibility criteria and were randomized (Drug X: n=100, placebo: n=100). Overall, 195 participants (97.5%) completed the 12-week treatment period (Drug X: 98; placebo: 97). Five participants discontinued treatment (3 due to adverse events, 2 due to withdrawal of consent). All 200 randomized participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, and 198 who received at least 1 dose of study drug were included in the safety analysis.

**Baseline characteristics** are shown in Table 1. [Summarize key demographics and baseline measures]. [Note similarity/balance between groups].

**Example:**
Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups (Table 1). The mean (SD) age was 57.8 (9.3) years, 96 participants (48%) were female, and 140 (70%) were White. The mean (SD) duration of diabetes was 7.2 (4.5) years, mean body mass index was 32.5 (4.2), and mean HbA1c was 8.2% (0.9%). All participants were taking metformin (mean dose: 1850 mg/day).

| Metformin dose, mean (SD), mg/day | 1860 (310) | 1840 (295) |

### Primary Outcome

[Primary results with full statistics]

At week 12, the mean (SD) change in HbA1c from baseline was [X]% in the Drug X group and [Y]% in the placebo group. The between-group difference (Drug X minus placebo) was [Z]% (95% CI: [lower]-[upper]%; P=[value]) (Table 2, Figure 2). [State whether clinically meaningful threshold was met].

**Example:**
At week 12, the mean (SD) change in HbA1c from baseline was -1.2% (0.8%) in the Drug X group and -0.4% (0.6%) in the placebo group. The adjusted mean difference (Drug X minus placebo) from ANCOVA was -0.8% (95% CI: -1.0% to -0.6%; P<.001) (Table 2, Figure 2), exceeding the pre-specified minimally clinically important difference of 0.5%.

## DISCUSSION

[Interpretation, context, implications]

### Paragraph 1: Summary of Principal Findings

[Restate main findings - brief]

In this randomized clinical trial of [N] adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin, treatment with Drug X 100 mg once daily for 12 weeks resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c compared with placebo. The observed between-group difference of [X]% exceeded the pre-specified minimally important difference of [Y]%. [Key secondary findings]. The safety profile was generally favorable, with [brief safety summary].

**Example:**
In this randomized clinical trial of 200 adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin, treatment with Drug X 100 mg once daily for 12 weeks resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c compared with placebo (adjusted mean difference: -0.8%; 95% CI: -1.0% to -0.6%; P<.001). This exceeded the pre-specified minimally clinically important difference of 0.5%. Drug X also significantly reduced fasting glucose and body weight. The treatment was generally well tolerated, with a similar overall rate of adverse events compared with placebo.

### Paragraph 2-3: Comparison with Existing Literature

[Put findings in context of previous studies]

These findings are consistent with [reference to similar studies] and extend previous research by [how this study adds to knowledge]. [Compare effect sizes to other treatments in same class or for same indication]. [Explain differences if results diverge from prior studies].

The HbA1c reduction of [X]% with Drug X is comparable to that observed with [other therapies], which typically achieve reductions of [range].[refs] For example, [specific comparison study] reported [result]. Our findings of [unique aspect] add to the literature by [contribution].

[Address any contradictory findings in the literature and potential explanations]

### Paragraph 4: Mechanisms and Clinical Significance

[Why these results make sense - connect to mechanism/biology]

The glucose-lowering effect of Drug X is likely mediated by [mechanism of action]. [Explain how mechanism leads to observed effects]. The magnitude of HbA1c reduction observed in this study is clinically relevant, as [epidemiologic data showing impact of X% HbA1c reduction on outcomes].[refs]

The favorable effects on body weight observed with Drug X may provide additional benefit, as weight loss is associated with [improved outcomes in diabetes]. [Further mechanistic discussion if relevant].

### Paragraph 5: Strengths

**Strengths** of this study include:
- [Rigorous design elements: randomization, blinding, etc.]
- [High completion rate]
- [Pre-specified outcomes and analysis plan]
- [Diverse/representative population]
- [Adequate sample size]
- [Central laboratory/standardized assessments]

**Example:**
Strengths of this study include the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, high completion rate (98%), pre-specified outcomes and statistical analysis plan, diverse study population representative of US adults with type 2 diabetes, adequate sample size with power to detect clinically meaningful differences, and use of a central laboratory for all efficacy assessments.

### Paragraph 6: Limitations

**Limitations** include:
- [Short duration - long-term efficacy/safety unknown]
- [Selected population - generalizability concerns]
- [Single dose studied]
- [Surrogate endpoint vs clinical outcomes]
- [Other limitations specific to study]

**Example:**
This study has several limitations. First, the 12-week treatment duration does not permit assessment of long-term efficacy or safety. Longer studies are needed to determine whether the glucose-lowering effect is sustained and to characterize the safety profile with extended use. Second, participants were required to meet specific eligibility criteria and were enrolled at specialized research centers, which may limit generalizability to community practice. Third, only a single dose of Drug X (100 mg) was evaluated; dose-response relationships remain to be established. Fourth, we assessed HbA1c, a validated surrogate endpoint, but did not evaluate clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events or diabetes complications. Finally, [other limitation].

### Paragraph 7: Clinical Implications and Future Directions

[What do these findings mean for practice and research?]

These findings suggest that Drug X may be [suitable for what patient population / clinical scenario]. [How it fits into treatment algorithm]. [For whom it might be particularly appropriate]. However, [caveats before clinical use - need for additional studies, regulatory approval, cost considerations, etc.].

Future research should focus on [list key questions]:
- Longer-term studies to assess durability of effect and safety
- Cardiovascular outcomes trials
- Comparative effectiveness vs other glucose-lowering agents
- Optimal dosing strategies
- [Other specific questions raised by this study]

### Final Paragraph: Conclusions

[Concise conclusion - answer the research question]

**Conclusions**

Among adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin, treatment with Drug X 100 mg once daily for 12 weeks, compared with placebo, resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c. These findings support further evaluation of Drug X as a treatment option for type 2 diabetes, including longer-term studies to assess durability and safety.

## Key Manuscript Writing Principles

**1. IMRAD Structure - Non-Negotiable:**
Every research manuscript follows: Introduction, Methods, Results, And Discussion

**2. CONSORT/STROBE Compliance:**
- RCTs: Must follow CONSORT (complete checklist, include flow diagram)
- Observational studies: Must follow STROBE
- Systematic reviews: Must follow PRISMA

**3. Precision in Reporting:**
- Report effect sizes with 95% CI, not just p-values
- Include denominators: "50 of 100 patients (50%)" not "50%"
- Specify exact p-values (p=0.03) unless <0.001
- Use consistent decimal places throughout

**4. Results vs Discussion:**
- Results: Numbers only, no interpretation
- Discussion: Interpretation, comparison, implications
- Never mix these sections

**5. Journal-Specific Requirements:**
- Check word limits (abstract, main text, references)
- Follow journal's reference style
- Include required statements (data sharing, COI, funding)
- Use journal's preferred terminology

**6. Author Contributions and Ethics:**
- ICMJE authorship criteria
- Full COI disclosure
- Data sharing statement (ICMJE journals)
- Trial registration number in abstract

**7. Writing Style:**
- Active voice acceptable in Methods (We conducted...)
- Past tense for what you did (We found...)
- Present tense for established facts (Diabetes is...)
- Concise and clear - avoid jargon

## Common Manuscript Pitfalls to Avoid

**❌ AVOID:**
- Overinterpreting results
- Discussing results in Results section
- Citing results in Introduction
- Omitting CI when reporting p-values
- Changing outcome definitions from protocol
- Inadequate limitation discussion
- Missing CONSORT flow diagram (RCTs)
- Vague statistical methods
- Unclear what population was analyzed
- Unsupported conclusions

**✅ DO:**
- Stick to what data show
- Keep Results objective
- Cite published literature only
- Report effect size, CI, and p-value together
- Analyze pre-specified outcomes as defined
- Honest, thorough limitations section
- Include all CONSORT elements
- Detailed stat methods (allow replication)
- Clearly define analysis populations (ITT, PP, Safety)
- Conclusions match results

## Output Format

Generate manuscripts in structured Markdown with:
- Complete IMRAD sections
- Placeholder tables (indicate data needed)
- Reference placeholders [ref] to be filled with actual citations
- Comments [in brackets] for guidance
- Track word counts by section

## Upon Completion

After generating manuscript:

1. **Provide summary** of key elements
2. **Generate CONSORT/STROBE checklist** (as appropriate)
3. **Create data sharing statement** template
4. **List missing information** needed to complete manuscript
5. **Suggest target journals** based on study impact and results
6. **Provide journal-specific guidance** for final formatting
7. **Offer to revise** specific sections based on feedback
